Reader, as you sit in your peaceful home, surrounded by the calm of civilisation, can you recall the grand heroic memories of the past, which after centuries remain illuminated with a bright glow, and are also often darkened with blood and tragedy?  Can you transport yourself back to the joys and terrors of the past, and take a vital interest in those struggles and battles long since fought out, and become full of hopes or fears as fortune smiled or betrayed?  Stand with me on the heights of History, and looking far around on the wild arena of human destiny, can you transfer yourself to the vale of the past, the physically dead and buried, but spiritually immortal life, which forms the being and substance of all History?  Reader, have you ever seen History depicted as an aged man with a frozen heart and wise brow, trying all things in the balance of reason? But is not the Genius of History like an ever youthful virgin, full of fire, with a living heart and a flaming soul--human, warm, and beautiful?  If then you have the capacity to suffer or rejoice with the generations that have passed away, to love, and hate with them, to admire, despise, and curse as they have done; in a word, to live amongst them with your whole heart, and not merely with your cold reflecting mentality, then follow me
I will lead down the valley; but your heart will guide you better that I; upon that I rely--and begin
"Stälhandske," said he, checking his large steed at the last Finnish division, "I suppose you understand why you are here
I rely upon you Finns to receive him right royally
"  The king then raised his voice and said,  "Boys, do not blunt your swords upon those iron-clad fellows, but first tackle the horses, and then you will have light work with the riders
"Well, Bertila," said Stälhandske, turning to a young man who in the first rank rode a handsome black horse, and was noticeable from his height and bearing, "do you feel inclined to win the knight's spur to-day?"  The one addressed seemed astonished, and coloured up to the brim of his helmet
"Thunder and lightning, the boy blushes like a bride at the altar!  A peasant's son?  What the devil, then, have we all come from in the beginning?  Did you not provide four fully equipped horsemen?  Has not our Lord placed a heart in your breast, and the king a weapon in your hand?  That is in itself a coat of arms; you must attend to the rest
I thank you, my children!  I am proud of you
"But," continued the king, "there was one among you who sprang from his horse, and first of all scaled the heights to seize the Imperial guns
To-morrow morning, at seven o'clock, you may present yourself, to hear your doom
"  "At least I will mark you first, so that we may know you if we meet again," cried one of the soldiers named Vitikka, renowned for his strength and brutality
"  "His son did you say?"  The young man bowed his head and blushed
He then said,  "Why have you not announced yourself to me before?  Your father has done my father and the country great service
"  "And no one has mentioned you for promotion?"  "My colonel has promised to remember me
"I have something more to say to you
I have been told that you dismounted at the foot of the steepest hill, so that you could get up quicker
"  "And that you reached the top of the hill first, whilst the others had to ride round; and that you killed two of the enemy, and took the first cannon
"  "It is good, sub-lieutenant Bertila; I forgive you, and promote you to the rank of lieutenant in my Finnish cavalry
"Lieutenant Bertila, you are brave and noble, and you have received a military education
In your position as officer in my army you are already considered a nobleman
That none of my officers shall look down upon you as a peasant's son, I will give you a name, and the knight's spur
Go, my son," repeated the king with great emotion, "and show that you are worth the king's favour
And if some day you can obtain it for your own sake, and not only for the sake of your father's name, then give him this letter, and tell him that it is my last will
"Do you know what this letter contains?"  "No, your Majesty
He forbids you ever to bear a noble name, if you wish to avoid his curse
"The noble name which I had intended for you, you cannot accept
Do not feel sad, my young friend, you shall keep your sword and your lieutenant's commission; with them, and your brave arm, the path to honour will always be open to you
"And so you think," anxiously asked Regina, "that these terrible heretics will venture as far as this place?"  "The protection of the saints will be with beauty and faith," answered the count evasively
But," continued the Jesuit, his voice acquiring suddenly a commanding tone, "what is this I see, my daughter?  Why are you still here, and the castle filled with women and children, while the enemy may arrive at any moment at your gates?"  "Lady Regina shall never need a protector as long as I am alive," exclaimed Count Fritz
"But, worthy father, you are fatigued, you are wounded, and need rest
Allow me to dress your wounds; you are hurt in the head
"Do you see," said Lady Regina to Ketchen, "the two cavaliers in their yellow waistcoats, who ride at the head of the heretics?"  "How handsome they are!  Now they turn round the street corner--there they are again
"Fräulein Ketchen, you should have been on the field of Breitenfeld
Nine thousand corpses!"  "It is horrible!"  "Count, can you inform me who those horsemen are, who, in spite of the storm of cannon-shot, keep on the river bank and seem to be closely examining the defences of our castle?"  "Pardon me, charming cousin, the smoke blocks my sight
"My cousin, why do you thus regard the heretic leader?"  "Beautiful Regina, why do your eyes flash fire at the thought
You are, yourself, so generous and noble, can you not understand my sympathy for a brave and chivalrous foe?  The king of Sweden is a hero, well worthy of our supreme admiration, as well as of our great enmity
"  "I fail to comprehend you
A heretic!"  "God preserve you from some day seeing him within these walls; you will then understand me much better
"  "Count, do you fear?" Regina smiled as she said this
"Hearken, and you will every now and then distinguish a peculiar whizzing, and a rattling like the fall of stones; you do not know what this is
I will tell you
These are cannon-shot, Lady Regina; you would know this better if the noise outside was not so deafening
"  "Do you really think----"  "That the enemy intend to destroy this turret, and will fill the castle moat with the debris?  Yes, cousin, and I believe they will do it very soon
"Go," she exclaimed; "you are weak in the faith; you doubt the protection of the holy saints
"You must away!  Now you see for yourself!" cried the count
"Cease your efforts," said the veteran in a firm tone, "it is a needless waste of powder; you are trying to kill a man with a charmed life; he is invulnerable
But how do you know this, my son?" he added
"  "Nothing affects him, you believe?  Oh, _maledicti Fennones_, why do you follow me everywhere?"  "No iron or lead," whispered the veteran, "but I can tell you of something else
"  "Say on, my son; you are absolved beforehand
"Thank the saints, my fair cousin, that you took my advice yesterday
Can you see?  Father Hieronymus is on his knees by the large gun
"Wait, ruler of Belial, until I succeed in taking your ring from you, and then you shalt be destroyed!"  The king now commanded an assault on the outworks
"Do you realise what you are asking for, my daughter?"  "Victory for the Catholic faith
Have you sufficient devotion to hate the enemies of the faith, even if ever, as a woman, you felt tempted to love one of them?"  "I have, my father; yes, I declare it!"  "You are my penitent, and I would save your soul from eternal damnation
Have you courage to sacrifice yourself for the holy faith, and thereby secure the eternal crown of a martyr?"  "Yes, my father!"  "Very well; then know that the fortress will be taken in a short time
You will be a prisoner; you are young and beautiful, and may easily win the king's favour
When you can approach his person, and the Holy Virgin grants an opportunity, you must----"  The Jesuit now took out a crucifix of silver, and when he pressed a spring in the breast of the image, a keen dagger flew out
Do you love the Holy Virgin?"  "You know that I do
Do you love me also, my daughter?"  "I revere you more than anyone else, my father
Do you still hesitate to avenge the mother of God and myself?"  "What must I do, my father?"  "Listen!  The heretic king wears on his right forefinger a ring of copper; this is a talisman against death and injury
"As you see," said the youth, shaking his hand cordially
But say, why have you changed your name, Bertel?  What sort of a mixture is it? neither Swedish or Finnish
"  "Well, I hope you are not too proud to bear a peasant's name, now you are an officer?"  "Have the lots already been drawn?" said Bertel
If you are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this ebook
"Stand up," he said to them, "and no evil shall befall you
Gustaf Adolf saw this, and said, laughing, "Never mind, boys; now that it has once come into your hands, you may as well keep it
See to it, that you are not smitten, lieutenant, and above all give close heed to the monk; that set is not to be relied upon

Have you understood me?"  "Yes, your Majesty
"  The king then raised his voice and said,  "Boys, do not blunt your swords upon those iron-clad fellows, but first tackle the horses, and then you will have light work with the riders
"I should be happy if the mourning you wear covered a heart that could forget all sad memories and only live in the hope of a brighter future, when war and battles no longer frighten the colour away from your beautiful cheeks
Believe me, lady, the time will come, and I am wishing for it with all my heart as much as you are, and let this hope bring joy to these lips where it always ought to remain
"Well, Bertila," said Stälhandske, turning to a young man who in the first rank rode a handsome black horse, and was noticeable from his height and bearing, "do you feel inclined to win the knight's spur to-day?"  The one addressed seemed astonished, and coloured up to the brim of his helmet

"Are you not well, lady?"  "Very well, your Majesty
"  "Perhaps you have something to complain of?  Have confidence in me--as a friend!"  "Your Majesty is very kind----"  Regina struggled with herself
"Holy Virgin," she prayed, "forgive me, that my heart does not belong to you alone
I thank you, my children!  I am proud of you
"But," continued the king, "there was one among you who sprang from his horse, and first of all scaled the heights to seize the Imperial guns
You who can see into my inmost being, you know that I have not enough strength to hate this heretic king as you demand of me
Woe unto me, I shudder to think of the holy charge you have given me!"  "Courage, my daughter," whispered a voice close by, and Lady Regina's evil spirit, the pale Jesuit, stood behind her
To-morrow morning, at seven o'clock, you may present yourself, to hear your doom
"  "Oh, my father, my father, what do you demand of me?"  "Listen to me, my daughter

When Holofernes, the King of Assyria, besieged Bethulia, there was a widow, Judith, the daughter of Merari, beautiful as you, my child, devoted as you

"  "What shall I do, my father?"  "Mark closely how you ought to deport yourself
This very evening you must request a private audience of the king
He then said,  "Why have you not announced yourself to me before?  Your father has done my father and the country great service

I have been told that you dismounted at the foot of the steepest hill, so that you could get up quicker

"  "And that you reached the top of the hill first, whilst the others had to ride round; and that you killed two of the enemy, and took the first cannon
"  "It is good, sub-lieutenant Bertila; I forgive you, and promote you to the rank of lieutenant in my Finnish cavalry
I should first of all like to know who you are
"Lieutenant Bertila, you are brave and noble, and you have received a military education
"What now leads you to seek an audience with me?  Speak, I beg of you; tell me without fear what troubles you have in your heart; will you not comply with my wish?"  Lady Regina sighed deeply, and began to speak in a low voice almost impossible to hear, but she gradually assumed a louder tone, supported by her enthusiasm
In your position as officer in my army you are already considered a nobleman
"Your Majesty, I have come to you because you asked me to come
That none of my officers shall look down upon you as a peasant's son, I will give you a name, and the knight's spur
I come to you because I have hated you, sire; for a long time I have prayed daily to the Holy Virgin, that she would destroy you, and your whole army
Your Majesty, I am only a weak girl, but an honest Catholic; you have pursued our Church with war, and plundered our convents; driven away our holy fathers, and melted down our holy golden images; you have slain our soldiers, and dealt our cause deadly blows that can never be repaired
Go, my son," repeated the king with great emotion, "and show that you are worth the king's favour
Therefore I have taken a Holy Oath to bring about your destruction, and relying upon the Holy Virgin's help I have followed your steps from Würzburg in order to kill you
And if some day you can obtain it for your own sake, and not only for the sake of your father's name, then give him this letter, and tell him that it is my last will
"Sire, you think me mad, because I speak thus to the conqueror of Germany
"Do you know what this letter contains?"  "No, your Majesty
He forbids you ever to bear a noble name, if you wish to avoid his curse
When I saw you for the first time in the castle of Würzburg, and how kindly and generously you sheltered the weak, and spared those who had been captured, I then said to myself, 'This conduct seems to be inspired from Heaven, but nevertheless it must come from hell
'  But when I followed you here, and saw your greatness as a man combined with your heroic qualities, sire, I hesitated to carry out my vow, and my hatred became a burden to me
"The noble name which I had intended for you, you cannot accept
Do not feel sad, my young friend, you shall keep your sword and your lieutenant's commission; with them, and your brave arm, the path to honour will always be open to you
Sire, now I love you as much as I have hated you before
"Your Majesty, I have made this confession because you are great and noble enough not to misunderstand me
"And so you think," anxiously asked Regina, "that these terrible heretics will venture as far as this place?"  "The protection of the saints will be with beauty and faith," answered the count evasively
But I have not come to you at this late hour only to confess an unhappy girl's feelings
But," continued the Jesuit, his voice acquiring suddenly a commanding tone, "what is this I see, my daughter?  Why are you still here, and the castle filled with women and children, while the enemy may arrive at any moment at your gates?"  "Lady Regina shall never need a protector as long as I am alive," exclaimed Count Fritz
Some of our body, men without mercy, have sworn to kill you
"But, worthy father, you are fatigued, you are wounded, and need rest
Allow me to dress your wounds; you are hurt in the head
Oh! you do not know what these men are capable of doing
They have drawn lots in order to decide who shall kill you, and the most dangerous of them is near you in disguise daily
"Do you see," said Lady Regina to Ketchen, "the two cavaliers in their yellow waistcoats, who ride at the head of the heretics?"  "How handsome they are!  Now they turn round the street corner--there they are again
To-day or to-morrow, perhaps, you may be assassinated or poisoned
"Fräulein Ketchen, you should have been on the field of Breitenfeld
Nine thousand corpses!"  "It is horrible!"  "Count, can you inform me who those horsemen are, who, in spite of the storm of cannon-shot, keep on the river bank and seem to be closely examining the defences of our castle?"  "Pardon me, charming cousin, the smoke blocks my sight
I know that you rely upon this ring"--and Regina grasped the king's hand--"but it will not help you
"My cousin, why do you thus regard the heretic leader?"  "Beautiful Regina, why do your eyes flash fire at the thought
Sire, I say to you that your death is certain, and I have not come here to save your life and thus betray the cause of our Holy Church
You are, yourself, so generous and noble, can you not understand my sympathy for a brave and chivalrous foe?  The king of Sweden is a hero, well worthy of our supreme admiration, as well as of our great enmity
"  "Then why, lady, did you come here now?"  Lady Regina again threw herself at the king's feet with almost adoration
"  "I fail to comprehend you
Hear me, I beg, I implore you by your eternal salvation, with certain death staring you in the face, do not continue in your heretical faith, whose fruit is eternal damnation
She will receive you with open arms, and whether your Majesty lives or dies, your Majesty can always depend upon being placed among the chosen saints in Heaven
A heretic!"  "God preserve you from some day seeing him within these walls; you will then understand me much better
"  The king for the second time raised the young girl from the ground, and looked straight into her burning eyes, and said in an impressive voice:  "When I was as young as you are, Lady von Emmeritz, my teacher, old Skytte, brought me up with the same enthusiastic devotion to the Protestant faith that you have for the Catholic
"  "Count, do you fear?" Regina smiled as she said this
At that time I hated the Pope with all my soul, as you now hate Luther, and I prayed to God that the time might come when I could destroy Antichrist and convert all those that believed in him to the true light
"Hearken, and you will every now and then distinguish a peculiar whizzing, and a rattling like the fall of stones; you do not know what this is
I will tell you
Go, Lady von Emmeritz, I forgive you; although deluded by the fanatical teachings of the monks, you have tried to draw me from the battle for the Light
These are cannon-shot, Lady Regina; you would know this better if the noise outside was not so deafening
Go, poor child, and let the Word of God, and the lessons of Life, teach you not to rely upon saints, who are no better than we are, or images, or rings, as they cannot alter the highest law
I thank you because your intentions are good, although you are inexperienced
"  "Do you really think----"  "That the enemy intend to destroy this turret, and will fill the castle moat with the debris?  Yes, cousin, and I believe they will do it very soon
"Go," she exclaimed; "you are weak in the faith; you doubt the protection of the holy saints
With his Majesty's permission I will furnish you with a larger audience
"You must away!  Now you see for yourself!" cried the count
"Do as you think best, minister," said the king
"Really, one must say that you are very zealous
"Cease your efforts," said the veteran in a firm tone, "it is a needless waste of powder; you are trying to kill a man with a charmed life; he is invulnerable
But how do you know this, my son?" he added
And for such a holy purpose you carry with you the image of the crucified Saviour?"  The monk bowed whilst devoutly making the sign of the cross
"  "Nothing affects him, you believe?  Oh, _maledicti Fennones_, why do you follow me everywhere?"  "No iron or lead," whispered the veteran, "but I can tell you of something else
A keen dagger, just suitable to thrust through a noble king's heart! Miserable monk," said Oxenstjerna in a terrible voice, "do you know that your horrible crime becomes a hundred times more detestable through the blasphemous method you wish to employ?"  Like all the kings of the Vasa line, Gustaf Adolf had a hasty temper in his youth, which more than once brought him into trouble
"  "Say on, my son; you are absolved beforehand
But now I know you, servants of the devil; the Almighty God has delivered ye into my hand; I shall scatter ye like chaff; I shall punish you, ye desecrators of the temple; I shall follow you to the end of the world, as long as this arm is able to wield the Lord's sword
Ye have hitherto seen me mild and merciful, ye will now see me hard and terrible; I will destroy you and your accursed faith on earth; it will be such a judgment as the world has not seen since the destruction of Rome
"Thank the saints, my fair cousin, that you took my advice yesterday
Can you see?  Father Hieronymus is on his knees by the large gun
Take him at once to prison, and you shall answer for his safety with your head
Then you can go and take your place in the ranks
"Wait, ruler of Belial, until I succeed in taking your ring from you, and then you shalt be destroyed!"  The king now commanded an assault on the outworks
From this moment you are degraded to the position of a private soldier
"Do you realise what you are asking for, my daughter?"  "Victory for the Catholic faith
Have you sufficient devotion to hate the enemies of the faith, even if ever, as a woman, you felt tempted to love one of them?"  "I have, my father; yes, I declare it!"  "You are my penitent, and I would save your soul from eternal damnation
What do you wish me to think of you?"  Lady Regina had courage enough to lift up her eyes once more to the great king
You wished to convert me; I will instead educate you, you seem to be in great want of it
Have you courage to sacrifice yourself for the holy faith, and thereby secure the eternal crown of a martyr?"  "Yes, my father!"  "Very well; then know that the fortress will be taken in a short time
Go, you remain my prisoner until you have learned to speak the truth
You will be a prisoner; you are young and beautiful, and may easily win the king's favour
When you can approach his person, and the Holy Virgin grants an opportunity, you must----"  The Jesuit now took out a crucifix of silver, and when he pressed a spring in the breast of the image, a keen dagger flew out
"  "That will be easy for me to do," said Pekka; "see, you can already see the lights shining from Hämeenlinna
Do you love the Holy Virgin?"  "You know that I do
"Listen, comrades," whispered he Ito the prisoners lying on the ground, "was it Finnish you spoke?"  "Go to the devil!" said Vitikka in a rage
Do you love me also, my daughter?"  "I revere you more than anyone else, my father
"You are welcome to me, lieutenant, and thank you for our last meeting
"What have you done with your ears, monk?" he said tauntingly
Do you still hesitate to avenge the mother of God and myself?"  "What must I do, my father?"  "Listen!  The heretic king wears on his right forefinger a ring of copper; this is a talisman against death and injury
"Take away your skull-cap, foul thief, and let us see if you have grown any ass's ears in their place
"As you see," said the youth, shaking his hand cordially
But say, why have you changed your name, Bertel?  What sort of a mixture is it? neither Swedish or Finnish
Vitikka replied stubbornly, "Now you think you are clever, but you are only a fumbler in comparison with the devil
"  "Well, I hope you are not too proud to bear a peasant's name, now you are an officer?"  "Have the lots already been drawn?" said Bertel
"Will you now abjure your faith, and believe in the Holy Father and damn Luther, and you shall keep your other ear?"  "Niggard!" cried the Finn
"Your lord and master generally offers countries and kingdoms, and you only offer me a wretched ear!"  "The left ear," continued the Jesuit coldly
"Kill us, if you like, but do it quickly!"  "Who has said that I intend to kill you?" replied the Jesuit, smirking
"Stand up," he said to them, "and no evil shall befall you
"Never; it entirely depends upon yourself whether you regain your freedom this very night
Gustaf Adolf saw this, and said, laughing, "Never mind, boys; now that it has once come into your hands, you may as well keep it
"  "What do you ask of me?"  "You are a brave young man, Lieutenant Bertel!  I am sorry that the king so shamefully and unjustly deprived you of your rank, which you had gained with your blood
See to it, that you are not smitten, lieutenant, and above all give close heed to the monk; that set is not to be relied upon
"I have not forgotten that you were the first one who entered the sally-port
"  "Are you really sorry?  And what then?"  "If I was in your place I should take revenge
When you have brought the young lady to safety, you must appear on duty in my life-guards
Do you know, young friend, what the Catholic princes would give to anyone who brought the king, dead or alive, into their power?"  "How could I know that, holy father?"  "A kingdom if he was a nobleman; 50,000 ducats if he was a man of the people
"  "You have your choice between death and a royal reward!"  "This is the point you were trying to reach, holy father?"  "Do as you please; think it over, and we will talk about it again
Have you understood me?"  "Yes, your Majesty
This time you can buy your life and freedom for a less price; yes, a very small service
I wish you to swear that you will do me a very small favour
"I should be happy if the mourning you wear covered a heart that could forget all sad memories and only live in the hope of a brighter future, when war and battles no longer frighten the colour away from your beautiful cheeks
Believe me, lady, the time will come, and I am wishing for it with all my heart as much as you are, and let this hope bring joy to these lips where it always ought to remain
"  "And the ring?"  "The ring; you must swear to deliver it into my hands before the next new moon
Do this, and you are free!"  "Oh, only a small sin against the seventh commandment?  And you have the absolution ready before-hand; is it not so?  Go, miserable thief, and thank your stars that my arm is bound; or by Heaven, it would teach you to have respect for a Christian's honour!"  "Be still, young man, remember that your life is in my hands
"Are you not well, lady?"  "Very well, your Majesty
"  "Perhaps you have something to complain of?  Have confidence in me--as a friend!"  "Your Majesty is very kind----"  Regina struggled with herself
When I have finished with your comrade I shall begin with you
"Holy Virgin," she prayed, "forgive me, that my heart does not belong to you alone
"Thunder and lightning, is it you, Bertel?  Is it here you intend to leave the king's orders?"  "And yourself?"  "Yes, damn it, you know that I am always a lucky child!  I was sent to guard a convoy, and met on the road some rascally marauders, who told me that there was an ambush in the forest
You who can see into my inmost being, you know that I have not enough strength to hate this heretic king as you demand of me
"  "Larsson, I beg you to give me the girl!"  "What the devil are you thinking of?  Do you want to take the girl from me?"  "Let her go free, I beg of you!"  "Later on, perhaps, yes
Woe unto me, I shudder to think of the holy charge you have given me!"  "Courage, my daughter," whispered a voice close by, and Lady Regina's evil spirit, the pale Jesuit, stood behind her
"Are you mad?" said Larsson, laughing; "it is only a few of the rascals who have killed so many of our brave comrades
"  "Oh, my father, my father, what do you demand of me?"  "Listen to me, my daughter
When Holofernes, the King of Assyria, besieged Bethulia, there was a widow, Judith, the daughter of Merari, beautiful as you, my child, devoted as you
The king's war council advised him not to make the attack; Duke Bernhard was the only one who advised him to the contrary, and the king shared his opinion, "because," he said, "it is necessary to wash one's self perfectly clean once you are in the bath
"  "What shall I do, my father?"  "Mark closely how you ought to deport yourself
"The power of the Almighty, and nothing else, has protected our great king, but the ring was given to him long ago by a young Finnish girl, whom he loved in his youth; I know more about this than you do
This very evening you must request a private audience of the king
"  Duke Bernhard, who, sad and sorrowful, was watching the king's pale features, turned round at these words; he put his sound hand underneath his open buff waistcoat, and said to the Finn:  "Comrade, do you know one of Stälhandske's officers named Bertel?"  "Yes, your grace
He will listen to you
"Peace?  Share?  No war?  Pshaw! cousin, pshaw! would you make an ant's nest of the world?  What a state of things!  Scribblers would smother everything with ink; cowards and petty tyrants would sit on honest men; and when one nation domineered over another, people would lowly bow, thank them, and act like sheep
Once in possession of it, I will be ready to assist you
Ink has made you, brother, a postmaster; in ink you live and have your being; ink brings your daily bread, and what would you be with blood alone, and no ink, may I ask?  "What should I be?  Devils and heretics
But if he refuses you the ring, then take this paper, it contains a deadly poison; St
"I only ask what kind of a man was Gustaf Adolf?  What kind of a man was Napoleon?  Were they only birthday eaters of sweetmeats?  What do you think?  Were they fools or savages?  I pray you
Do you hear, cousin?  I do not swear, cousin; you should have heard Fieandt, how devilishly he swore at Karstula
"Have you understood me, my daughter?" asked he
"Thank you
I should first of all like to know who you are
"What now leads you to seek an audience with me?  Speak, I beg of you; tell me without fear what troubles you have in your heart; will you not comply with my wish?"  Lady Regina sighed deeply, and began to speak in a low voice almost impossible to hear, but she gradually assumed a louder tone, supported by her enthusiasm
"  "I will tell you what I know about the Finns," said the surgeon; "but I assure you beforehand that it is altogether too little
"Your Majesty, I have come to you because you asked me to come
The playing child launches its little boat from the beach; look around you, little one, and see well the point where the waters trace their edges; when you become a man, you will look in vain for your present strand--beyond the green fields you will hear their distant murmur; and when you are an old man, a village may appear on the spot once occupied by the waves
Nature is awake for three months of the year in an unbroken day, and then at midnight you can read the finest print; three months of night, but a night of moonlight and glittering snow--clear, cold, and solemn
I come to you because I have hated you, sire; for a long time I have prayed daily to the Holy Virgin, that she would destroy you, and your whole army
Your Majesty, I am only a weak girl, but an honest Catholic; you have pursued our Church with war, and plundered our convents; driven away our holy fathers, and melted down our holy golden images; you have slain our soldiers, and dealt our cause deadly blows that can never be repaired
Do not trouble, Meri; we will go to the house, and you shall not work any more to-day
"You see, I do not; I forbid you to work
Therefore I have taken a Holy Oath to bring about your destruction, and relying upon the Holy Virgin's help I have followed your steps from Würzburg in order to kill you
Even if your father turned me out of doors, and I had to beg my bread, you should not work any more to-day
"Sire, you think me mad, because I speak thus to the conqueror of Germany
When I saw you for the first time in the castle of Würzburg, and how kindly and generously you sheltered the weak, and spared those who had been captured, I then said to myself, 'This conduct seems to be inspired from Heaven, but nevertheless it must come from hell
He knows that you are not strong; you are like your dead mother, who was a lady by birth, and from your education in Stockholm
'  But when I followed you here, and saw your greatness as a man combined with your heroic qualities, sire, I hesitated to carry out my vow, and my hatred became a burden to me
"Do you remember this tract thirty-four years ago, when Fleming's cavalry scoured the country like savages, the village lay in ruins, and the fields were trampled down by the horses' hoofs
Sire, now I love you as much as I have hated you before
"I know none other than my son Gösta, born of my second wife during the journey to Stockholm; and God be merciful unto you if ever
"Your Majesty, I have made this confession because you are great and noble enough not to misunderstand me
"  "Tell me, if you can, Larsson, what constituents are required for an honest Christian Government?"  Larsson looked at him with surprise
"I will tell you
But I have not come to you at this late hour only to confess an unhappy girl's feelings
"  "I know you hate the nobles
Some of our body, men without mercy, have sworn to kill you
Oh! you do not know what these men are capable of doing
"  "Bertila, what do you mean?"  "I mean that in my childhood I heard King Erik's son, in spite of his peasant wife, Karin, declared the successor to the crown
"  "Are you in your senses?"  Again an ironical smile played around the old man's lips
They have drawn lots in order to decide who shall kill you, and the most dangerous of them is near you in disguise daily
"Do you not understand," he coldly said, "how it is possible to hate soldiers and aristocrats, and yet send one's son to war as the nearest road to distinction, under a king's eyes?"  "I beg of you, Bertila, put aside such wild fancies; you are a reasonable man when the demon of pride does not get possession of your restless mind
To-day or to-morrow, perhaps, you may be assassinated or poisoned
"  "What!  Not fail!"  "No!  Have I not told you that Gösta must be either king or peasant? Either
I know that you rely upon this ring"--and Regina grasped the king's hand--"but it will not help you
Sire, I say to you that your death is certain, and I have not come here to save your life and thus betray the cause of our Holy Church
"  "But if he will not remain a peasant?  Supposing he wishes to fight for a coat of arms, and becomes a nobleman?  Remember, you have started him on the right road for that end; as an officer he is already an equal of the nobility
"  "Then why, lady, did you come here now?"  Lady Regina again threw herself at the king's feet with almost adoration
"  "His blood!  Then you no longer remember that nobility is in it from both sides?  His education! and you sent him to Stockholm at twelve, and allowed him to grow up amongst young aristocrats, whom he has constantly heard express themselves with contempt about the peasantry
Hear me, I beg, I implore you by your eternal salvation, with certain death staring you in the face, do not continue in your heretical faith, whose fruit is eternal damnation
Your will! foolish father to think that you can bend a youth's desires from the direction given to them by such powerful influences
"  The old man remained silent for a time, then he said, coldly,  "Larsson, you are a credulous fool; I joke, and you take it seriously
She will receive you with open arms, and whether your Majesty lives or dies, your Majesty can always depend upon being placed among the chosen saints in Heaven
"  The king for the second time raised the young girl from the ground, and looked straight into her burning eyes, and said in an impressive voice:  "When I was as young as you are, Lady von Emmeritz, my teacher, old Skytte, brought me up with the same enthusiastic devotion to the Protestant faith that you have for the Catholic
Let us say no more about it; but take care, not a word of what has passed!  Do you understand?"  "I am your old friend, Bertila
Since the time when I, a horseman with Svidje Klas, helped you to escape from Ilmola, you have repaid me the service many times over; I shall never betray you
At that time I hated the Pope with all my soul, as you now hate Luther, and I prayed to God that the time might come when I could destroy Antichrist and convert all those that believed in him to the true light
Go, Lady von Emmeritz, I forgive you; although deluded by the fanatical teachings of the monks, you have tried to draw me from the battle for the Light
But, you see, I love your children as my own, and cannot bear to see you make the boy unhappy; and Meri
are you a father, Bertila?  How do you treat your child, your only daughter, who attends to your lightest wish, and does everything to atone for the fault of her youth?  You treat her worse than any of your servants; you allow her frail and weak body to perform the hardest work; she sinks to the ground, and you do not raise her
Go, poor child, and let the Word of God, and the lessons of Life, teach you not to rely upon saints, who are no better than we are, or images, or rings, as they cannot alter the highest law
You are cruel, Bertila; you are an inhuman father
I thank you because your intentions are good, although you are inexperienced
I have said what I think about the intermediate class, and now you know the reason for my actions
With his Majesty's permission I will furnish you with a larger audience
"Do as you think best, minister," said the king
"What have you underneath your apron?  Out with it
"Really, one must say that you are very zealous
"I have told you many a time," he said severely, "that an honest peasant woman has nothing to do with fancy work
And for such a holy purpose you carry with you the image of the crucified Saviour?"  The monk bowed whilst devoutly making the sign of the cross
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Bertila," he said, "to insult your own daughter in front of all the people!  She works like a slave night and day, more than anyone of us, yet you call her a lazy thing! I tell you this straight in the face, that although you are my master, and I eat your bread, and without you I have nothing but the beggar's staff, that such an unrighteous father does not deserve to have such a good daughter; and rather than see this misery day after day, I will beg my bread
But you will have to answer before the Almighty for your children
A keen dagger, just suitable to thrust through a noble king's heart! Miserable monk," said Oxenstjerna in a terrible voice, "do you know that your horrible crime becomes a hundred times more detestable through the blasphemous method you wish to employ?"  Like all the kings of the Vasa line, Gustaf Adolf had a hasty temper in his youth, which more than once brought him into trouble
And may you now say your grace, and let the food taste well to you if you can
But now I know you, servants of the devil; the Almighty God has delivered ye into my hand; I shall scatter ye like chaff; I shall punish you, ye desecrators of the temple; I shall follow you to the end of the world, as long as this arm is able to wield the Lord's sword
Ye have hitherto seen me mild and merciful, ye will now see me hard and terrible; I will destroy you and your accursed faith on earth; it will be such a judgment as the world has not seen since the destruction of Rome
"What is it you want?" he asked with regained self-possession
You wished to turn Larsson out of the house, and struck Simeon; you have done wrong
Take him at once to prison, and you shall answer for his safety with your head
Then you can go and take your place in the ranks
If you cannot endure to live with your aged father, then you are at liberty to stay on my farm at Ilmola
"Do not reject me, father," she said, "I will never desert you
From this moment you are degraded to the position of a private soldier
Have you any ale?"  The old man in the high seat, who had not yet quite overcome his temper, although he appeared to be calm, rose from his chair, but at once sat down again
What do you wish me to think of you?"  Lady Regina had courage enough to lift up her eyes once more to the great king
Confidence for confidence, I will now tell you that I am Bengt Kristerson, from Limingo, sergeant in his Majesty's brave East Bothnians
You wished to convert me; I will instead educate you, you seem to be in great want of it
Go, you remain my prisoner until you have learned to speak the truth
well, do not be afraid, girls, I will not bite you
Bertila," added the soldier with his mouth full, "what the deuce is this?  Are you Lieutenant Bertel's father, peasant?"  "I do not know that name," replied the old man, who was nettled by the soldier's impudent remarks
"Are you mad, old man?  You do not know Gustaf Bertel, who six months ago called himself Bertila?"  "My son! my son!" cried the old man in a voice of anguish
"  "That will be easy for me to do," said Pekka; "see, you can already see the lights shining from Hämeenlinna
You are a fine fellow, old man; tell me what the d----l you want with a name?"  He then looked at his host with such an air of naïve impudence, that the insulting words were somewhat modified in effect
"Listen, comrades," whispered he Ito the prisoners lying on the ground, "was it Finnish you spoke?"  "Go to the devil!" said Vitikka in a rage
"You peasants associate so much with oxen and sheep, that you become just like them yourselves
"You are welcome to me, lieutenant, and thank you for our last meeting
"What have you done with your ears, monk?" he said tauntingly
If you were a bit civil you would send a pretty girl to fill my jug
"Take away your skull-cap, foul thief, and let us see if you have grown any ass's ears in their place
It is now empty, you see; as empty as your cranium
But you turnip-peelers do not appreciate the honour which is conferred upon you, of having a royal sergeant for guest
Vitikka replied stubbornly, "Now you think you are clever, but you are only a fumbler in comparison with the devil
But you, old ploughshare, have nothing but porridge in your head and a turnip in your breast; fill your mug, old fellow; here's to Lieutenant Bertel's success!  So you refuse to drink the health of an honest cavalier?  Out upon you, peasant
"Will you now abjure your faith, and believe in the Holy Father and damn Luther, and you shall keep your other ear?"  "Niggard!" cried the Finn
"Your lord and master generally offers countries and kingdoms, and you only offer me a wretched ear!"  "The left ear," continued the Jesuit coldly
"  "Yes," said Larsson, who always tried to defend Fleming and his people, "that time you had the best of it
Eleven soldiers remained alive, but seeming to be dead, you took all their clothes
"Kill us, if you like, but do it quickly!"  "Who has said that I intend to kill you?" replied the Jesuit, smirking
"Never; it entirely depends upon yourself whether you regain your freedom this very night
And at midnight they crept half dead with cold to the vicarage, and were there taken in; but in the morning you wanted to put them in the water underneath the ice, alive, as you had done in Lappfjard's River
The water was so low in the river that you had to push the men down with poles to keep them there; and when they tried to get up, the women knocked them on their heads with buckets
"  "What do you ask of me?"  "You are a brave young man, Lieutenant Bertel!  I am sorry that the king so shamefully and unjustly deprived you of your rank, which you had gained with your blood
"  "Keep quiet, Larsson, you do not know all that Svidje Klas did," said Bertila angrily; "I say nothing about all the men that he and his people have killed and broken on the wheel
"  "Are you really sorry?  And what then?"  "If I was in your place I should take revenge
Do you remember Severin Sigfridson at Sorsankoski?  He surrounded the peasants, and ordered his subaltern to behead them one by one; but he was not able to kill more than twenty-four, and asked the nobleman to finish the rest himself
Do you know, young friend, what the Catholic princes would give to anyone who brought the king, dead or alive, into their power?"  "How could I know that, holy father?"  "A kingdom if he was a nobleman; 50,000 ducats if he was a man of the people
"  "You have your choice between death and a royal reward!"  "This is the point you were trying to reach, holy father?"  "Do as you please; think it over, and we will talk about it again
"  "But what did you do, you mad brutes, on Peter Gumse's farm?  Your men destroyed the place, broke the windows, slaughtered all the cattle, and set their severed heads with wide open mouths in the windows as a scare
Then the beams of the house were cut three parts through, so that when the folk came home it would fall upon their heads; and when you caught a horseman you used him as a target for your arrows
This time you can buy your life and freedom for a less price; yes, a very small service
I wish you to swear that you will do me a very small favour
Do you remember when Axel Kurk's men came and killed a woman's children before her eyes?  The poor mother could not stand this, she and her half-grown daughter seized the brute by the waist, hit him on the head with a pole, and pushed him fainting in the water
"  "Instead of molesting the sergeant, you should have asked him for news about your son and mine," said Larsson, to get away from their usual contentious subject--the fatal Peasant War
"  "And the ring?"  "The ring; you must swear to deliver it into my hands before the next new moon
Do this, and you are free!"  "Oh, only a small sin against the seventh commandment?  And you have the absolution ready before-hand; is it not so?  Go, miserable thief, and thank your stars that my arm is bound; or by Heaven, it would teach you to have respect for a Christian's honour!"  "Be still, young man, remember that your life is in my hands
"Yes, you are right
When I have finished with your comrade I shall begin with you
"Do you know, Dorthe," she said, "that the Finns whom you hate live on the coast of this sea?  Do you see that strip of land over there in the east?  It is Finland
"Thunder and lightning, is it you, Bertel?  Is it here you intend to leave the king's orders?"  "And yourself?"  "Yes, damn it, you know that I am always a lucky child!  I was sent to guard a convoy, and met on the road some rascally marauders, who told me that there was an ambush in the forest
Patrick preserve us from ever setting foot upon its cursed soil; my dear lady, you have then never heard what is said of this land and its heathen people?  There prevails an eternal night; there the snow never melts; there the wild beasts and the still wilder men lie together in dens and caves
"  "Larsson, I beg you to give me the girl!"  "What the devil are you thinking of?  Do you want to take the girl from me?"  "Let her go free, I beg of you!"  "Later on, perhaps, yes
"Are you mad?" said Larsson, laughing; "it is only a few of the rascals who have killed so many of our brave comrades
A glorious land is Finland, were it such as you represent it to me
"There you have it yourself, dear lady
The king's war council advised him not to make the attack; Duke Bernhard was the only one who advised him to the contrary, and the king shared his opinion, "because," he said, "it is necessary to wash one's self perfectly clean once you are in the bath
Take care! Do you not see how angry he looks, the log-house king?  If he had his way, he would plough up the whole town and make it into a rye-field!"  The hot-tempered Bertila concealed his resentment, and hurried up the horse, so as to arrive quickly at the widow's house, where he generally resided when in town
"The power of the Almighty, and nothing else, has protected our great king, but the ring was given to him long ago by a young Finnish girl, whom he loved in his youth; I know more about this than you do
"  Duke Bernhard, who, sad and sorrowful, was watching the king's pale features, turned round at these words; he put his sound hand underneath his open buff waistcoat, and said to the Finn:  "Comrade, do you know one of Stälhandske's officers named Bertel?"  "Yes, your grace
"Aha, old fellow!" exclaimed the jovial serjeant, Bengt Kristerson, whom Bertila had so ignominiously expelled from his house, "now we have got you, and I will recompense you for your gracious treatment yesterday
"  "Do you hear that, boys?" cried one of the subalterns; "the dog boasts of thrashing brave soldiers
"Peace?  Share?  No war?  Pshaw! cousin, pshaw! would you make an ant's nest of the world?  What a state of things!  Scribblers would smother everything with ink; cowards and petty tyrants would sit on honest men; and when one nation domineered over another, people would lowly bow, thank them, and act like sheep
"What the devil are you about?  Are you honest soldiers?  Do you not see that the old man is seventy years old, and yet you go six to one at him! Blitz-donner-kreutz-Pappenheim (the sergeant had learned this potent oath in the proper school, and it never failed in its effect), is that warlike?  What would the king say about it?  Out of the way, boys; the old man is mine; I alone have the right to wash him clean
Ink has made you, brother, a postmaster; in ink you live and have your being; ink brings your daily bread, and what would you be with blood alone, and no ink, may I ask?  "What should I be?  Devils and heretics
"Do you know what it means, peasant," cried the sergeant with an authoritative air, which would have become General Stälhandske himself, "to throw a soldier of the great king down the steps?  Do you know what it means to knock off the hat of a defender of the evangelical faith, and a conqueror who has gained fourteen battles and run his sword through sixteen or seventeen living generals?  Do you know, peasant, if I were in your place----?"  "If I stood in the place of a soldier of his Majesty," coolly answered Bertila, "I would respect an honest man in his own house, and a grandsire's old age
"I only ask what kind of a man was Gustaf Adolf?  What kind of a man was Napoleon?  Were they only birthday eaters of sweetmeats?  What do you think?  Were they fools or savages?  I pray you
Then he stepped close up to his opponent, and said in a bragging manner:  "Do you know, peasant, that I could impale you on this?" and so saying, he drew his long sword half-way from its sheath
Do you hear, cousin?  I do not swear, cousin; you should have heard Fieandt, how devilishly he swore at Karstula
"Are you not afraid, old man?" resumed the hero of fourteen battles, evidently taken aback by the peasant's firm attitude
"Thank you
"Did you ever see an honest Finn afraid?" said the old man, almost smiling
"  "I will tell you what I know about the Finns," said the surgeon; "but I assure you beforehand that it is altogether too little
"Do you know, boys," he said, with a look at his companions, "that the old ox has got both horns and hoofs?  He might have become something in the world if he had been in good society
The playing child launches its little boat from the beach; look around you, little one, and see well the point where the waters trace their edges; when you become a man, you will look in vain for your present strand--beyond the green fields you will hear their distant murmur; and when you are an old man, a village may appear on the spot once occupied by the waves
Yesterday, when they were fourteen to one--for you should know, boys, that all fourteen of the hands helped to lift me on the clodhopper's back, and then I gave everyone of them a remembrance of it--yes, as I say, yesterday I would have beaten the old fellow black and blue, had it not been for the presence of ladies at the table
Nature is awake for three months of the year in an unbroken day, and then at midnight you can read the finest print; three months of night, but a night of moonlight and glittering snow--clear, cold, and solemn
Yes, indeed; do you remember the Hollanders last year, how they bolted molten lead?  I do not wish to say anything, but just look--the black-haired nun is as pale as death!"  "Has she given the king poison?" cried a trembling female voice close behind
Do not trouble, Meri; we will go to the house, and you shall not work any more to-day
Look at her: do you not see that the devil has kept his word?  Take care; in those eyes there is something that charms and bewitches
"You see, I do not; I forbid you to work
Even if your father turned me out of doors, and I had to beg my bread, you should not work any more to-day
"Did she also love the king?"  "What is there more curious than a woman?  How the deuce do you expect me to know all about it?  The foul-fiend is wiser than other folks, that is certain
He knows that you are not strong; you are like your dead mother, who was a lady by birth, and from your education in Stockholm
"  "What the devil do you know about that?  I have heard of the seven circles, but not of the plate
"Do you remember this tract thirty-four years ago, when Fleming's cavalry scoured the country like savages, the village lay in ruins, and the fields were trampled down by the horses' hoofs
She advanced with lively southern gesticulations, and screamed, beside herself with anger:  "Miserable Finnish witch, how dare you treat a high-born lady in such a manner?  Do you know, vile jailor, whom you have the honour of receiving in your house?  You do not!  Then I will tell you
George and the Holy Virgin will descend and destroy you, you heathen; and if you harm a hair of our heads, this castle shall be levelled to the ground, and you, miserable witch, and your whole town, annihilated
"I know none other than my son Gösta, born of my second wife during the journey to Stockholm; and God be merciful unto you if ever
Follow the laws of the country you are in
"  "Tell me, if you can, Larsson, what constituents are required for an honest Christian Government?"  Larsson looked at him with surprise
"I will tell you
At eight supper is served, at nine you go to bed, and at four in the morning you get up, and if you don't know how to card and spin, I will give you some sewing, so that time shall not hang heavy on your hands
Then we will talk together, and when your waiting woman learns to hold her tongue you may have her back again
"  "I know you hate the nobles
"  "Bertila, what do you mean?"  "I mean that in my childhood I heard King Erik's son, in spite of his peasant wife, Karin, declared the successor to the crown
"I'll all forget, and firmly stand,   If you give me the dread command   To stop the hero's great career
"  "Are you in your senses?"  Again an ironical smile played around the old man's lips
"Do you not understand," he coldly said, "how it is possible to hate soldiers and aristocrats, and yet send one's son to war as the nearest road to distinction, under a king's eyes?"  "I beg of you, Bertila, put aside such wild fancies; you are a reasonable man when the demon of pride does not get possession of your restless mind
"Fly, your grace," she said rapidly in Swedish; "fly, a great danger threatens you; the soldiers are intoxicated and frantic; they say that you have tried to kill the king, and they demand your life
"  "What!  Not fail!"  "No!  Have I not told you that Gösta must be either king or peasant? Either
"Who are you, and what can you tell me about the great Gustaf Adolf?"  "Lose not a moment, your grace," continued Meri, ignoring Regina's question
"They are already at the gates, and Fru Marta, with six soldiers, will not be able to protect you against two hundred
"  "But if he will not remain a peasant?  Supposing he wishes to fight for a coat of arms, and becomes a nobleman?  Remember, you have started him on the right road for that end; as an officer he is already an equal of the nobility
Quick! don't come out by the door, but tie together sheets and shawls, and let yourself down through the window; I will receive you
"  "His blood!  Then you no longer remember that nobility is in it from both sides?  His education! and you sent him to Stockholm at twelve, and allowed him to grow up amongst young aristocrats, whom he has constantly heard express themselves with contempt about the peasantry
Your will! foolish father to think that you can bend a youth's desires from the direction given to them by such powerful influences
"Ye crazy boors!" shrieked the brave dame with more energy than courtesy, "may the devil take you all, drunken ale-bibbers!  Be off this instant, or, as sure as my name is Marta Ulfsparre, you shall have a taste of 'Master Hans' on the back, you villains, sots, shameless knaves, and night loafers!"  "Master Hans" was a good-sized braided rattan, which seldom left Fru Marta's hand, and for which all the inmates of the castle entertained a profound respect
"  The old man remained silent for a time, then he said, coldly,  "Larsson, you are a credulous fool; I joke, and you take it seriously
"Do you hear, you pack of thieves?" she screamed, mounted on a ladder, so that her white night-cap was seen in the moonlight just above the gate, "if you don't take yourselves off this minute from his Majesty's castle, I will make my cannon shatter you into fragments, like cabbage stalks, you noisy, drunken swine!  Angry dogs get torn skins; and the chicken who sticks his neck in the jaws of the fox will have to look around to see where his head is
I will cut you to pieces, you rowdy set," continued Fru Marta, getting more and more excited
Let us say no more about it; but take care, not a word of what has passed!  Do you understand?"  "I am your old friend, Bertila
Since the time when I, a horseman with Svidje Klas, helped you to escape from Ilmola, you have repaid me the service many times over; I shall never betray you
"I will let them make mince-meat of you, and throw you to the----"  Unhappily the brave commander was not allowed to finish her heroic speech
But, you see, I love your children as my own, and cannot bear to see you make the boy unhappy; and Meri
"What did I tell you?" shrieked Fru Marta from the window; "didn't I tell you, drunkards and vagabonds, that you ought to think seven times before putting your noses between the wedges of the tree, and if the tail has once got into the fox-trap, there is nothing left but to bite it off
are you a father, Bertila?  How do you treat your child, your only daughter, who attends to your lightest wish, and does everything to atone for the fault of her youth?  You treat her worse than any of your servants; you allow her frail and weak body to perform the hardest work; she sinks to the ground, and you do not raise her
"If I had you down here I would, blitz-donner-kreutz-Pappenheim, teach you to insult brave soldiers with offers of surrender
You are cruel, Bertila; you are an inhuman father
Be at ease; your witch is in good keeping; Korsholm has bolts and bars for you too, miscreants!"  But as if a capricious destiny wished to convict the old lady of error and put her to the blush, a tall, dark female figure now appeared on the top of the ramparts, and was outlined against the clear night sky
I have said what I think about the intermediate class, and now you know the reason for my actions
Be converted, therefore, to the Holy Virgin and all the saints, acknowledge the Pope to be Christ's vicegerent, as he truly is, that you may avert St
George's sword from your heads, which is already raised to destroy you
"What have you underneath your apron?  Out with it
But you can kill me in order to seal the veracity of my faith; here I stand; why do you hesitate?  I am ready to die for my faith
"I have told you many a time," he said severely, "that an honest peasant woman has nothing to do with fancy work
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Bertila," he said, "to insult your own daughter in front of all the people!  She works like a slave night and day, more than anyone of us, yet you call her a lazy thing! I tell you this straight in the face, that although you are my master, and I eat your bread, and without you I have nothing but the beggar's staff, that such an unrighteous father does not deserve to have such a good daughter; and rather than see this misery day after day, I will beg my bread
By my soul, I think you consider us warriors like chickens!"  "Yes," added the surgeon, when the captain was about to continue, "I know what you wish to say: exactly like Fieandt at Karstula
But you will have to answer before the Almighty for your children
As for the funeral, you need not give yourself any trouble; I will attend to that myself
And may you now say your grace, and let the food taste well to you if you can
It is a positive crime!"  "Dear cousin," said the grandmother, at once vexed and delighted, "I am the one to be blamed; we thought you must be drowned
"What is it you want?" he asked with regained self-possession
And I tell you what, cousin, they would have been spared from upsetting my room, and sticking their noses into my affairs, had not the Swedes quadrupled the rate, compared with old times
Then I thought, 'let the Medical College go to the dogs!' and began my old practice with the lancet and 'essentia dulcis,' as I went along; and all the old women--God bless you, I thought you were going to sneeze--and all the old women were amazed to see former times revived
You wished to turn Larsson out of the house, and struck Simeon; you have done wrong
If you cannot endure to live with your aged father, then you are at liberty to stay on my farm at Ilmola
* * * * *  "My dear friends," began the surgeon, "it may puzzle you why I call this story 'Fire and Water
Perhaps you think that I shall now treat you to natural history
"Do not reject me, father," she said, "I will never desert you
Have you any ale?"  The old man in the high seat, who had not yet quite overcome his temper, although he appeared to be calm, rose from his chair, but at once sat down again
I intend to tell you about four persons: two of whom possessed a fiery nature, and two a watery
'  I might have alarmed you with the terrible title of 'The Curse'; but when I came to think it over, I found that it could just as well be styled 'The Blessing
Confidence for confidence, I will now tell you that I am Bengt Kristerson, from Limingo, sergeant in his Majesty's brave East Bothnians
well, do not be afraid, girls, I will not bite you
'  Therefore you will have to be contented with the elements; I have now said all I wished, and I will leave you to guess the rest
Bertila," added the soldier with his mouth full, "what the deuce is this?  Are you Lieutenant Bertel's father, peasant?"  "I do not know that name," replied the old man, who was nettled by the soldier's impudent remarks
"  "Fool!" replied the other; "do you not know that the heretic king's death is going to be celebrated with a great festival at Ingolstadt? The reverend father intends to hold a grand _auto-de-fé_ in honour of the happy event
"Are you mad, old man?  You do not know Gustaf Bertel, who six months ago called himself Bertila?"  "My son! my son!" cried the old man in a voice of anguish
"I will tell you something
You are a fine fellow, old man; tell me what the d----l you want with a name?"  He then looked at his host with such an air of naïve impudence, that the insulting words were somewhat modified in effect
Your health!"  "What else did you hear from East Bothnia?" inquired Bertel, who with the bashfulness of youth, blushed at the thought of revealing to his prosaic friend the secret of his heart--his love for the dark-eyed and unhappy Lady Regina von Emmeritz
Meri pines for you and sings doleful songs
"You peasants associate so much with oxen and sheep, that you become just like them yourselves
Do you remember that splendid girl, Katri? round as a turnip, red as mountain-ash berries, and soft about the chin as a lump of butter
If you were a bit civil you would send a pretty girl to fill my jug
"Nothing more!  What the devil do you want to know, when you don't care for the prettiest girl in the whole of Storkyro
It is now empty, you see; as empty as your cranium
But you turnip-peelers do not appreciate the honour which is conferred upon you, of having a royal sergeant for guest
what next?  What the deuce, boy?  Are you in love with the girl?  Faint like a lady's maid!  Courage! did I say that they had burned her?  No, my lad, she was only a little scorched, according to what Bengt Kristerson says, and afterwards she tore Fru Marta's eyes out, and climbed like a squirrel to the top of the castle
Well, I declare, you have got both your eyes open at last
But you, old ploughshare, have nothing but porridge in your head and a turnip in your breast; fill your mug, old fellow; here's to Lieutenant Bertel's success!  So you refuse to drink the health of an honest cavalier?  Out upon you, peasant
You are still alive, you milk-baked wheat loaf
"  "Yes," said Larsson, who always tried to defend Fleming and his people, "that time you had the best of it
Eleven soldiers remained alive, but seeming to be dead, you took all their clothes
are you not ashamed to behave like a poltroon?  You are a pretty soldier!  blitz-donnerwetter-kreutz-Pappenheim, you are a pomade pot!  D--n it, now the tankard is empty also!"  The stout little warrior would perhaps have continued to vent his bad humour for some time longer, especially as there was no consolation now left in the cup, had not the door opened, and a female figure then stepped over the threshold
And at midnight they crept half dead with cold to the vicarage, and were there taken in; but in the morning you wanted to put them in the water underneath the ice, alive, as you had done in Lappfjard's River
I will bet it is a long time since you saw twenty-seven
The water was so low in the river that you had to push the men down with poles to keep them there; and when they tried to get up, the women knocked them on their heads with buckets
"Your name, you kind angel, who remembers the prisoners!" he cried
"  "Keep quiet, Larsson, you do not know all that Svidje Klas did," said Bertila angrily; "I say nothing about all the men that he and his people have killed and broken on the wheel
Ah!  I should have known you amongst thousands
Do you remember Severin Sigfridson at Sorsankoski?  He surrounded the peasants, and ordered his subaltern to behead them one by one; but he was not able to kill more than twenty-four, and asked the nobleman to finish the rest himself
you are Regina, yourself!"  "You make a mistake," said the same kind voice that Bertel had heard the day before
"  "But what did you do, you mad brutes, on Peter Gumse's farm?  Your men destroyed the place, broke the windows, slaughtered all the cattle, and set their severed heads with wide open mouths in the windows as a scare
"I wished to have you in my care, but now you make me leave the place to another
Then the beams of the house were cut three parts through, so that when the folk came home it would fall upon their heads; and when you caught a horseman you used him as a target for your arrows
What do you think of it?"  "I?  What should I care; they might burn a dozen witches for our amusement
Do you remember when Axel Kurk's men came and killed a woman's children before her eyes?  The poor mother could not stand this, she and her half-grown daughter seized the brute by the waist, hit him on the head with a pole, and pushed him fainting in the water
"Be still, like a good child, highly honoured abbess," mockingly said the captain; "if you make a sound you are lost
By right I ought to throw you out of the window and let you have a swim in the Main, to teach you _punctum preciosum_, that is, a precise punctuality in your attendance
"  "Instead of molesting the sergeant, you should have asked him for news about your son and mine," said Larsson, to get away from their usual contentious subject--the fatal Peasant War
"Yes, you are right
But I will give you grace for this night
Tell me, you most miserable of meal bringers, what is the meaning of that fire which they are preparing on the square; who is going to be roasted there?"  "For the sake of all the saints, speak low," whispered the nun
"Do you know, Dorthe," she said, "that the Finns whom you hate live on the coast of this sea?  Do you see that strip of land over there in the east?  It is Finland
"I am Ketchen, and have come to save you
Patrick preserve us from ever setting foot upon its cursed soil; my dear lady, you have then never heard what is said of this land and its heathen people?  There prevails an eternal night; there the snow never melts; there the wild beasts and the still wilder men lie together in dens and caves
A great danger threatens you
A glorious land is Finland, were it such as you represent it to me
To-morrow the bishop is expected, and Father Hieronymus, the implacable enemy of all the Finns, has sworn to burn you alive for the glory of the saints
"There you have it yourself, dear lady
But Ketchen freed herself, and said quickly:  "If you do not behave yourself, young man, you will afford fuel for the flames
Take care! Do you not see how angry he looks, the log-house king?  If he had his way, he would plough up the whole town and make it into a rye-field!"  The hot-tempered Bertila concealed his resentment, and hurried up the horse, so as to arrive quickly at the widow's house, where he generally resided when in town
"Bind you
"Aha, old fellow!" exclaimed the jovial serjeant, Bengt Kristerson, whom Bertila had so ignominiously expelled from his house, "now we have got you, and I will recompense you for your gracious treatment yesterday
"  "Do you hear that, boys?" cried one of the subalterns; "the dog boasts of thrashing brave soldiers
Very well, hasten, Bertel! hurry, Pekka, you lazy dog!  Farewell, little rogue! another kiss
"What the devil are you about?  Are you honest soldiers?  Do you not see that the old man is seventy years old, and yet you go six to one at him! Blitz-donner-kreutz-Pappenheim (the sergeant had learned this potent oath in the proper school, and it never failed in its effect), is that warlike?  What would the king say about it?  Out of the way, boys; the old man is mine; I alone have the right to wash him clean
Are you alive, Bertel?"  "Yes
"  "Do you believe that, Bertel?" asked the captain in a lugubrious tone
"Do you know what it means, peasant," cried the sergeant with an authoritative air, which would have become General Stälhandske himself, "to throw a soldier of the great king down the steps?  Do you know what it means to knock off the hat of a defender of the evangelical faith, and a conqueror who has gained fourteen battles and run his sword through sixteen or seventeen living generals?  Do you know, peasant, if I were in your place----?"  "If I stood in the place of a soldier of his Majesty," coolly answered Bertila, "I would respect an honest man in his own house, and a grandsire's old age
Then he stepped close up to his opponent, and said in a bragging manner:  "Do you know, peasant, that I could impale you on this?" and so saying, he drew his long sword half-way from its sheath
"  "Listen to me, Bertel; you are a smart chap, but that does not prevent you from talking like a milksop occasionally
"Are you not afraid, old man?" resumed the hero of fourteen battles, evidently taken aback by the peasant's firm attitude
So you really fancy that they intend to roast us like picked woodcocks?"  "That entirely depends upon you yourselves," answered a voice in the darkness
"Did you ever see an honest Finn afraid?" said the old man, almost smiling
But the holy Church in its clemency wishes to save you, and has sent me here to offer you mercy
"Do you know, boys," he said, with a look at his companions, "that the old ox has got both horns and hoofs?  He might have become something in the world if he had been in good society
"Come, worthy father, loosen my bonds and let me embrace you
Yesterday, when they were fourteen to one--for you should know, boys, that all fourteen of the hands helped to lift me on the clodhopper's back, and then I gave everyone of them a remembrance of it--yes, as I say, yesterday I would have beaten the old fellow black and blue, had it not been for the presence of ladies at the table
I offer you my friendship, and of course you believe me
"  "I offer you mercy," continued the Jesuit coldly, "on _three_ conditions, which you will certainly accept
Yes, indeed; do you remember the Hollanders last year, how they bolted molten lead?  I do not wish to say anything, but just look--the black-haired nun is as pale as death!"  "Has she given the king poison?" cried a trembling female voice close behind
The first is, that you abjure your heretic faith and publicly join the only saving Church
Look at her: do you not see that the devil has kept his word?  Take care; in those eyes there is something that charms and bewitches
"Well, _posito_ that we abjure the Lutheran faith?"  "Then," continued the Jesuit, "as prisoners of war you shall be exchanged for the high-born Lady and Princess Regina von Emmeritz, whom your king tyrannically sent a prisoner to the north
"Did she also love the king?"  "What is there more curious than a woman?  How the deuce do you expect me to know all about it?  The foul-fiend is wiser than other folks, that is certain
"  "What the devil do you know about that?  I have heard of the seven circles, but not of the plate
"The king ordered Duke Bernhard to give you the ring, and you must have received it
"  The Jesuit moved towards the door, and said dryly,  "Then you choose the stake?"  "Rather than the disgrace of an apostasy!" exclaimed Bertel, who had not noticed Larsson's hints and motions
She advanced with lively southern gesticulations, and screamed, beside herself with anger:  "Miserable Finnish witch, how dare you treat a high-born lady in such a manner?  Do you know, vile jailor, whom you have the honour of receiving in your house?  You do not!  Then I will tell you
George and the Holy Virgin will descend and destroy you, you heathen; and if you harm a hair of our heads, this castle shall be levelled to the ground, and you, miserable witch, and your whole town, annihilated
"But only on three conditions: the first, that you renounce Loyola, your lord and master, and declare him to be an emissary of the devil
Do you agree to it?"  "I agree to everything," murmured the pater
Follow the laws of the country you are in
"The second: that you start off and hang yourself to the first hook you find in the ceiling
At eight supper is served, at nine you go to bed, and at four in the morning you get up, and if you don't know how to card and spin, I will give you some sewing, so that time shall not hang heavy on your hands
Then we will talk together, and when your waiting woman learns to hold her tongue you may have her back again
"  "The third: that you travel to Beelzebub, your patron,"
"  "I confess, my friend, that if anybody, even I, Larsson himself, should call you a poltroon, I would call that fellow a liar
"I'll all forget, and firmly stand,   If you give me the dread command   To stop the hero's great career
It is true that you once as good as _solo_, alone, _alienus_, all by yourself, took this fortress; but you had then at least a sword in your hand, and a few thousands of brave boys in the rear
"Fly, your grace," she said rapidly in Swedish; "fly, a great danger threatens you; the soldiers are intoxicated and frantic; they say that you have tried to kill the king, and they demand your life
Pious Jesuit, you have, anyhow, accomplished some good in the world!  Xmas eve, did you say?  Stupid, why didn't you tell us at once?  It is clear as the day, that half of Würzburg is streaming to the chapel to hear Father Hieronymus say mass
"Who are you, and what can you tell me about the great Gustaf Adolf?"  "Lose not a moment, your grace," continued Meri, ignoring Regina's question
"Be more careful another time," said Bertel, "and you will avoid drinking ink
"If we had nothing else to do I could show you something that ink has done," rejoined Bertel, as he hastily turned over a pile of papers on the writing-table
"They are already at the gates, and Fru Marta, with six soldiers, will not be able to protect you against two hundred
Quick! don't come out by the door, but tie together sheets and shawls, and let yourself down through the window; I will receive you
Hist! didn't you hear something?  A woman's voice
Be still!"  They stopped, and heard in the darkness a young female's voice, praying:  "Holy Virgin, forgive me this time, and save me from death; I will to-morrow take the veil, and serve you for ever
"Ye crazy boors!" shrieked the brave dame with more energy than courtesy, "may the devil take you all, drunken ale-bibbers!  Be off this instant, or, as sure as my name is Marta Ulfsparre, you shall have a taste of 'Master Hans' on the back, you villains, sots, shameless knaves, and night loafers!"  "Master Hans" was a good-sized braided rattan, which seldom left Fru Marta's hand, and for which all the inmates of the castle entertained a profound respect
"Do you hear, you pack of thieves?" she screamed, mounted on a ladder, so that her white night-cap was seen in the moonlight just above the gate, "if you don't take yourselves off this minute from his Majesty's castle, I will make my cannon shatter you into fragments, like cabbage stalks, you noisy, drunken swine!  Angry dogs get torn skins; and the chicken who sticks his neck in the jaws of the fox will have to look around to see where his head is
"  "Who the devil has said that you are to die, my brave girl?" interrupted the captain's voice
I will cut you to pieces, you rowdy set," continued Fru Marta, getting more and more excited
"No, you shall live, with your soft hand, and your warm lips, as true as I'm not a Jesuit, but Lars Larsson, captain in his Royal Majesty's and the Crown's service, and herewith take you
"I will let them make mince-meat of you, and throw you to the----"  Unhappily the brave commander was not allowed to finish her heroic speech
"Away, away, with or without the girl, but away; they are coming, and we still have to pass the large armoury!"  "Allow me to tell you, my friend Bertel, that you are the greatest fidget I know, _maximus fiescus_, as the ancients so truly expressed themselves
How is it, my girl, you are not a nun
"What did I tell you?" shrieked Fru Marta from the window; "didn't I tell you, drunkards and vagabonds, that you ought to think seven times before putting your noses between the wedges of the tree, and if the tail has once got into the fox-trap, there is nothing left but to bite it off
"The deuce, a mass-robe!  Wait, you take my cloak, and I will take the robe
"If I had you down here I would, blitz-donner-kreutz-Pappenheim, teach you to insult brave soldiers with offers of surrender
Come along, all of you
Be at ease; your witch is in good keeping; Korsholm has bolts and bars for you too, miscreants!"  But as if a capricious destiny wished to convict the old lady of error and put her to the blush, a tall, dark female figure now appeared on the top of the ramparts, and was outlined against the clear night sky
Be converted, therefore, to the Holy Virgin and all the saints, acknowledge the Pope to be Christ's vicegerent, as he truly is, that you may avert St
"The pious Father Hieronymus orders you to say mass with all your might
George's sword from your heads, which is already raised to destroy you
go to the devil, you bald-headed baboons!" roared Larsson, unable to restrain himself any longer, and pushing the obstinate monk into the chamber he bolted the door
But you can kill me in order to seal the veracity of my faith; here I stand; why do you hesitate?  I am ready to die for my faith
"  "Up, you sweetest of all the nuns in Franconia, up in the saddle!" and the captain hastily swung the trembling Ketchen before him on the horse's back
"  "What do you want?"  The young man coloured up and remained silent
By my soul, I think you consider us warriors like chickens!"  "Yes," added the surgeon, when the captain was about to continue, "I know what you wish to say: exactly like Fieandt at Karstula
I refuse it to you
As for the funeral, you need not give yourself any trouble; I will attend to that myself
"  "Well, What the devil do you want?  Can you not speak out?  Be short and quick!  Leave the clergy to say prayers, and the girls to blush
It is a positive crime!"  "Dear cousin," said the grandmother, at once vexed and delighted, "I am the one to be blamed; we thought you must be drowned
And I tell you what, cousin, they would have been spared from upsetting my room, and sticking their noses into my affairs, had not the Swedes quadrupled the rate, compared with old times
"  "No, your highness, the person you speak of is my elder sister, born of my father's first marriage
Then I thought, 'let the Medical College go to the dogs!' and began my old practice with the lancet and 'essentia dulcis,' as I went along; and all the old women--God bless you, I thought you were going to sneeze--and all the old women were amazed to see former times revived
Do you wish to hear any more, Lieutenant Bertel?"  "I do not understand, your highness, what this account of my sister's life has to do with
the ring you ask for
* * * * *  "My dear friends," began the surgeon, "it may puzzle you why I call this story 'Fire and Water
Perhaps you think that I shall now treat you to natural history
"Young man, you now know part of what you ought to know, but you do not know all
I intend to tell you about four persons: two of whom possessed a fiery nature, and two a watery
It was his Majesty's intention to offer you a nobleman's coat of arms, and which you with your good sword have so well deserved
But old Aron Bertila, actuated by his hatred for the nobility had asked as a favour that the king would give you an opportunity to gain any other distinction than that one
'  I might have alarmed you with the terrible title of 'The Curse'; but when I came to think it over, I found that it could just as well be styled 'The Blessing
'  Therefore you will have to be contented with the elements; I have now said all I wished, and I will leave you to guess the rest
The king could not refuse this request from a father, and therefore you are still a commoner by name
"How, my friend? you have only half understood me
"  "Fool!" replied the other; "do you not know that the heretic king's death is going to be celebrated with a great festival at Ingolstadt? The reverend father intends to hold a grand _auto-de-fé_ in honour of the happy event
"Well, with or without your knowledge and will, my friend, I already regard you as a nobleman
"I will tell you something
Do you remember what it was like?"  The duke now searched zealously in his portfolio
Your health!"  "What else did you hear from East Bothnia?" inquired Bertel, who with the bashfulness of youth, blushed at the thought of revealing to his prosaic friend the secret of his heart--his love for the dark-eyed and unhappy Lady Regina von Emmeritz
If I find it again I will give it to you, and if not, you know that which is worth more
Meri pines for you and sings doleful songs
Do you remember that splendid girl, Katri? round as a turnip, red as mountain-ash berries, and soft about the chin as a lump of butter
No one is to know what I have told you
"Nothing more!  What the devil do you want to know, when you don't care for the prettiest girl in the whole of Storkyro
Do you know, Meri, that I hate your king?"  "And I love him," said Meri in a scarcely audible voice
You are happy, Meri, you know nothing about the war, you do not know what Gustaf Adolf has done to the poor Catholics
what next?  What the deuce, boy?  Are you in love with the girl?  Faint like a lady's maid!  Courage! did I say that they had burned her?  No, my lad, she was only a little scorched, according to what Bengt Kristerson says, and afterwards she tore Fru Marta's eyes out, and climbed like a squirrel to the top of the castle
Well, I declare, you have got both your eyes open at last
"Did you see him when he was young?" she asked
You are still alive, you milk-baked wheat loaf
"  "And you have loved him like all the others?"  "More than all the others, lady
"  "And you love him still?"  "Yes, I love him much
are you not ashamed to behave like a poltroon?  You are a pretty soldier!  blitz-donnerwetter-kreutz-Pappenheim, you are a pomade pot!  D--n it, now the tankard is empty also!"  The stout little warrior would perhaps have continued to vent his bad humour for some time longer, especially as there was no consolation now left in the cup, had not the door opened, and a female figure then stepped over the threshold
Like you; but you would kill him and I would die for him
I will bet it is a long time since you saw twenty-seven
Oh, Holy Virgin, I would a thousand times give my life to save his!  But you do not know, Meri
"Your name, you kind angel, who remembers the prisoners!" he cried
It is an anguish that you cannot understand, it is a fearful conflict when one loves a man, a hero, the personification of the highest and grandest in life, and yet is commanded by a Holy Faith to hate this man, to kill him, to persecute him to the grave
Ah!  I should have known you amongst thousands
You do not know, happy one, who only needs to love and bless, what it means to be tossed between love and hate, like a ship on the mighty waves; to be obliged to curse one whom you bless in your heart, to sit within the walls of a prison a prey to the battling emotions which incessantly struggle for mastery in your innermost soul
you are Regina, yourself!"  "You make a mistake," said the same kind voice that Bertel had heard the day before
"I wished to have you in my care, but now you make me leave the place to another
But the saints did not grant me--unworthy being--so great an honour, and therefore I now sit here a prisoner on account of my faith and my love; and if an angel broke down the walls of my prison and said to me, 'Fly, your country again awaits you,' I would answer: 'It is his will, the beloved; for his sake I suffer, for his sake I remain,' and yet you believe that I wish to kill him
Meri with gentle hands removed the dark locks from her brow, and looking mildly and kindly into her tearful eyes, said with prophetic inspiration:  "Do not weep so, the day will arrive when you will be able to love without being obliged to curse him at the same time!"  "That day will never come, Meri
What do you think of it?"  "I?  What should I care; they might burn a dozen witches for our amusement
"  "Yes, lady, that day will come, not because you are younger and he is older
"Be still, like a good child, highly honoured abbess," mockingly said the captain; "if you make a sound you are lost
But have you never heard anyone say of a child which is brighter, kinder, and better than others, 'that child will not live long; it is too good for this world?'  So does it seem to me about King Gustaf Adolf
By right I ought to throw you out of the window and let you have a swim in the Main, to teach you _punctum preciosum_, that is, a precise punctuality in your attendance
But I will give you grace for this night
"Who are you that speaks such words?  How your eyes shine! you are not what you seem! who are you then?  Oh, Holy Virgin, protect me!"  And Regina started up with all the superstitious terror that belonged to her time
Tell me, you most miserable of meal bringers, what is the meaning of that fire which they are preparing on the square; who is going to be roasted there?"  "For the sake of all the saints, speak low," whispered the nun
"  "And you say that the king will die?"  "God alone presides over human destinies, and the greatest among mortals is still but a mortal
"I am Ketchen, and have come to save you
"  "Do you know it already?" answered Lady Marta, surprised
A great danger threatens you
To-morrow the bishop is expected, and Father Hieronymus, the implacable enemy of all the Finns, has sworn to burn you alive for the glory of the saints
"Go!" said he, short and sharp; "go, you reprobate boy, back to your brother noblemen, and your sisters, the fine ladies
What seek you in the plain peasant's 'stuga,' which you despise?  Go!  I have no longer a son!"  But the youth went not
But Ketchen freed herself, and said quickly:  "If you do not behave yourself, young man, you will afford fuel for the flames
"Bind you
Who sent me out amongst the great and illustrious ones of the earth, to win fame and honour?  Who bade me go to the war to ennoble my peasant name with great deeds?  Who exposed me to the temptation of all the brilliant examples which surrounded the king?  You, and only you, my father; and now you thrust away your son, who for your sake twice refused a patent of nobility
"You renounce a patent of nobility, you, who have blushed for your peasant name and taken another which would look more imposing?  No, on your knees have you begged for a coat of arms
Very well, hasten, Bertel! hurry, Pekka, you lazy dog!  Farewell, little rogue! another kiss
all this have I tried to teach you, and the fruit of my teachings has been that you have smuggled yourself among this nobility, which I hate and despise, that you have coveted its empty titles, paraded with its extravagant display, imbibed its prejudices, and now you stand here, in your father's house, with a lie on your lips, and aristocratic vanity in your heart
Are you alive, Bertel?"  "Yes
"Hullo, boys!" they exclaimed to the hands, "have you seen her?  Here is something that will pay
"  "Do you believe that, Bertel?" asked the captain in a lugubrious tone
"Wretch, what did you say?" he exclaimed
"  "Listen to me, Bertel; you are a smart chap, but that does not prevent you from talking like a milksop occasionally
"Ho, ho, if you please!  Be a little more careful when you speak to the people of the Royal Majesty and the Crown
So you really fancy that they intend to roast us like picked woodcocks?"  "That entirely depends upon you yourselves," answered a voice in the darkness
I tell you that the German traitress, the papistical sorceress, Lady von Emmeritz, succeeded in escaping last night from Korsholm castle, and that he who does not help to catch her is a traitor and a
But the holy Church in its clemency wishes to save you, and has sent me here to offer you mercy
"Come, worthy father, loosen my bonds and let me embrace you
"Ha, my father, you have wished it!" cried the young man, and in a flash was outside the door and in his sleigh, which at the next moment was heard driving off through the raging tempest
I offer you my friendship, and of course you believe me
"Wherever you like," answered his master just as testily
"Ass!" he cried, "have I not ordered you to drive north?"  "North!" repeated Pekka mechanically, and with a heavy sigh turned his horses towards Ny-Karleby, to which town it was quite forty miles
"  "I offer you mercy," continued the Jesuit coldly, "on _three_ conditions, which you will certainly accept
The first is, that you abjure your heretic faith and publicly join the only saving Church
"  "Do you not see something resembling a light, far away there in the woods?"  "Yes, yes, it looks like it
"  "Nonsense!  I tell you that we will ride there
"Well, _posito_ that we abjure the Lutheran faith?"  "Then," continued the Jesuit, "as prisoners of war you shall be exchanged for the high-born Lady and Princess Regina von Emmeritz, whom your king tyrannically sent a prisoner to the north
"The king ordered Duke Bernhard to give you the ring, and you must have received it
"  "You fool, it is only the pure snow!--and then you say people could not stand it any longer?"  "They all moved away, so that there was not even a cat left, except an old cottager, but I suppose he died long ago
"  The Jesuit moved towards the door, and said dryly,  "Then you choose the stake?"  "Rather than the disgrace of an apostasy!" exclaimed Bertel, who had not noticed Larsson's hints and motions
Did not I tell you that it would be so?  We shall never get out of this alive
Do you not see the old fire-place sticking out through the snow?  Not a step farther, master!"  "I am not mistaken
"But only on three conditions: the first, that you renounce Loyola, your lord and master, and declare him to be an emissary of the devil
Do you agree to it?"  "I agree to everything," murmured the pater
"I have told you that nobody but the devil himself lives in these woods
"  "Yes, you are right," said Bertel, now smiling at his own fears, and what he considered to be the offspring of his heated fancy
"The second: that you start off and hang yourself to the first hook you find in the ceiling
"  "The third: that you travel to Beelzebub, your patron,"
And yet you have just had a large fire kindled in the fire-place
"Will you now confess, old wretch?" burst out the excited young man
"  "I confess, my friend, that if anybody, even I, Larsson himself, should call you a poltroon, I would call that fellow a liar
It is true that you once as good as _solo_, alone, _alienus_, all by yourself, took this fortress; but you had then at least a sword in your hand, and a few thousands of brave boys in the rear
"Wretch," he exclaimed, "are you tired of life, or do you not know what you are doing, dotard?  What hinders me from crushing your miserable carcase against the walls of your own hut?"  The old man looked at him with an unchanging countenance
"Do so, Bertila's son," he replied; "kill your mother's old faithful servant if you wish; why should he live any longer?"  "My mother's old servant, do you say?"  "I am the last survivor of all those who formerly inhabited this fertile region, which is now a wilderness
Pious Jesuit, you have, anyhow, accomplished some good in the world!  Xmas eve, did you say?  Stupid, why didn't you tell us at once?  It is clear as the day, that half of Würzburg is streaming to the chapel to hear Father Hieronymus say mass
"  "But are you mad, old man?  If you are, as you say, my mother's old servant, why did you shut me up in that damned hole?  You must admit that your friendship is of a strange kind
"Be more careful another time," said Bertel, "and you will avoid drinking ink
Kill me, I am a Catholic!"  "You!  Well, by my sword now I begin to understand you
"If we had nothing else to do I could show you something that ink has done," rejoined Bertel, as he hastily turned over a pile of papers on the writing-table
Hist! didn't you hear something?  A woman's voice
"  "And on my arrival you concealed them
"  "Then you decoyed me into that miserable rat-hole, while you allowed the women and the monk to escape
Be still!"  They stopped, and heard in the darkness a young female's voice, praying:  "Holy Virgin, forgive me this time, and save me from death; I will to-morrow take the veil, and serve you for ever
"  "And what do you think that your reward will be?"  "Anything--death, perhaps
"  "Who the devil has said that you are to die, my brave girl?" interrupted the captain's voice
"  "I will spare your life on one condition: you shall show me the way the fugitives have taken
"No, you shall live, with your soft hand, and your warm lips, as true as I'm not a Jesuit, but Lars Larsson, captain in his Royal Majesty's and the Crown's service, and herewith take you
"Away, away, with or without the girl, but away; they are coming, and we still have to pass the large armoury!"  "Allow me to tell you, my friend Bertel, that you are the greatest fidget I know, _maximus fiescus_, as the ancients so truly expressed themselves
"  "My life; I told you that I was ninety years old
"  "And you do not fear the torture?"  "The saints be praised, if I was worthy of so great an honour
How is it, my girl, you are not a nun
"  "But if I burn you alive in your own hut?"  "The holy martyrs have been burnt at the stake
"The deuce, a mass-robe!  Wait, you take my cloak, and I will take the robe
Come along, all of you
"But I will tell you one thing," he continued, "you think that I have come to take the fugitives back to their prison
"The pious Father Hieronymus orders you to say mass with all your might
I give you my word of honour, that I will defend Lady Regina's freedom with my life's blood, and do all in my power to favour her flight
go to the devil, you bald-headed baboons!" roared Larsson, unable to restrain himself any longer, and pushing the obstinate monk into the chamber he bolted the door
Will you now tell me which way she has gone?"  "No, your grace," said the calm old man; "the young lady is under the protection of the saints, and a wise man's guidance
Turn back, you will not find any trace of the fugitives
"  "Up, you sweetest of all the nuns in Franconia, up in the saddle!" and the captain hastily swung the trembling Ketchen before him on the horse's back
To-night you are at liberty to walk, if you choose, six miles through the high snow-drifts, to the nearest farm
"  "What do you want?"  The young man coloured up and remained silent
To-morrow you can ride comfortably
I refuse it to you
"  "Well, What the devil do you want?  Can you not speak out?  Be short and quick!  Leave the clergy to say prayers, and the girls to blush
"  "Wretch! you have sent my horses away?"  "Yes, your grace
you must be hungry
"  "No, your highness, the person you speak of is my elder sister, born of my father's first marriage
Old man, where do you keep your snow-shoes?"  "My snow-shoes?" replied the old man, confused
Do you wish to hear any more, Lieutenant Bertel?"  "I do not understand, your highness, what this account of my sister's life has to do with
the ring you ask for
"Well, old friend," exclaimed the young cavalier, "what do you think of my horses?
I call them mine, for I will bet anything that you will sell them to me for three hard silver thalers: swifter steeds have seldom hurried over high snow-drifts
"Young man, you now know part of what you ought to know, but you do not know all
If you have any greeting for the monk or Lady Regina, I will take it with pleasure
It was his Majesty's intention to offer you a nobleman's coat of arms, and which you with your good sword have so well deserved
But old Aron Bertila, actuated by his hatred for the nobility had asked as a favour that the king would give you an opportunity to gain any other distinction than that one
It will be certain death to you
The king could not refuse this request from a father, and therefore you are still a commoner by name
But I forgive you for the sake of your excellent snow-shoes
"How, my friend? you have only half understood me
"Scoundrel!" cried Bertel, with glad surprise, "who sent you here?"  "Who?" repeated Pekka, equally delighted and astonished
"Well, with or without your knowledge and will, my friend, I already regard you as a nobleman
"Well, I shall tell you that the devil did it
Do you remember what it was like?"  The duke now searched zealously in his portfolio
But do you know one thing, Pekka: there are moments when hunger and want of sleep are even stronger than love itself
If I find it again I will give it to you, and if not, you know that which is worth more
This wood is good, and I take it, as you see, Excellency, right before the face of these vagabonds, who deserve to all hang upon the highest pine in the Paldamo forest
Pack yourselves off, you lazy, good-for-nothing rascals, and look out how you act before me and the Governor
No one is to know what I have told you
And you, Lucia, I warn you to hold your wicked tongue, which has already done so much mischief; otherwise it may happen that I shall again put you and your husband in that basement you know of, where Erik Hare kept you, and where the stream rolls right under the floor
Is this the thanks I get for the mild treatment I have bestowed upon you, that you are eternally exciting quarrels in the castle?  The day before yesterday you gave rein to your tongue, because you did not receive enough soap for your washing; yesterday you took a leg of mutton by force from my kitchen, and to-day you make a noise about the wood
Do you know, Meri, that I hate your king?"  "And I love him," said Meri in a scarcely audible voice
"How long do you think that mine will last
You are happy, Meri, you know nothing about the war, you do not know what Gustaf Adolf has done to the poor Catholics
Mark what I say: Sweden's greatest man; for the day will arrive when you, and I, and all these souls of lard, all these wandering ale-jugs, will be food for worms, and no more thought of than the hogs you killed to-day; but the glorious name of Johannes Messenius will shine for all time
"Did you see him when he was young?" she asked
"  "And you have loved him like all the others?"  "More than all the others, lady
Your patience!  Have I, then, had none--I who in these long weary years have been fighting with you for a bit of bread, for firewood, for a pillow for this great man, whom you abuse?  I, the only one who has kept his frail body alive, and strengthened his soul for the great work which he has now accomplished?  Do you realise what it means to suffer as I have; to be snatched away from one's children, to go about with despair in the heart, and a smile on the lips, so as to seem to have a hope when none remains?
Do you know, your Excellency, what all this means?  And you stand there and talk about your patience!"  The soldiers' loud laughter all at once interrupted the voluble old woman
"  "And you love him still?"  "Yes, I love him much
Like you; but you would kill him and I would die for him
Oh, Holy Virgin, I would a thousand times give my life to save his!  But you do not know, Meri
A little noise, however, was unavoidable; the old man at the table, startled from his thoughts, began to upbraid the intruder:  "Woman!" he said, "how dare you disturb me!  Have I not told you _iterum iterumque_, that you shall take away your _penates procul a parnasso_?  Do you understand it
It is an anguish that you cannot understand, it is a fearful conflict when one loves a man, a hero, the personification of the highest and grandest in life, and yet is commanded by a Holy Faith to hate this man, to kill him, to persecute him to the grave
_lupa_?"  "Dear Messenius, I am only bringing you a little wood
You do not know, happy one, who only needs to love and bless, what it means to be tossed between love and hate, like a ship on the mighty waves; to be obliged to curse one whom you bless in your heart, to sit within the walls of a prison a prey to the battling emotions which incessantly struggle for mastery in your innermost soul
I will not do it again; next time I will lay a mat under the wood, so that it will not disturb you
Now I will cook you a splendid leg of mutton for supper
But the saints did not grant me--unworthy being--so great an honour, and therefore I now sit here a prisoner on account of my faith and my love; and if an angel broke down the walls of my prison and said to me, 'Fly, your country again awaits you,' I would answer: 'It is his will, the beloved; for his sake I suffer, for his sake I remain,' and yet you believe that I wish to kill him
"  "What, woman! have you dared to beg _beneficia_ from tyrants?  By Jupiter, do you think me a dog, that I should eat the crumbs from their tables?  And then you limp
Meri with gentle hands removed the dark locks from her brow, and looking mildly and kindly into her tearful eyes, said with prophetic inspiration:  "Do not weep so, the day will arrive when you will be able to love without being obliged to curse him at the same time!"  "That day will never come, Meri
Why do you do that?  Answer me; why do you limp?  I suppose you have been running around like a gossiping old woman, and tripped on the stairs
"  "Yes, lady, that day will come, not because you are younger and he is older
But have you never heard anyone say of a child which is brighter, kinder, and better than others, 'that child will not live long; it is too good for this world?'  So does it seem to me about King Gustaf Adolf
Let me see the epitaph of the great Johannes Messenius!"  "Certainly," said the old man, consoled by her sincere flattery, "you are decidedly the true _persona executrix_ who ought to read my _epitaphium_, as you are also the one who will have to engrave it on my tombstone
Look, my dear; what do you think of this?  "Here lie the bones of Doctoris Johannes Messenii
"Who are you that speaks such words?  How your eyes shine! you are not what you seem! who are you then?  Oh, Holy Virgin, protect me!"  And Regina started up with all the superstitious terror that belonged to her time
"  "And you say that the king will die?"  "God alone presides over human destinies, and the greatest among mortals is still but a mortal
Do you know I have a feeling that its glory will in a short time prepare freedom for you
"Yes, you are right; the freedom of the grave to decay wherever one chooses
"  "Do you know it already?" answered Lady Marta, surprised
"  "No," replied Lucia with eagerness and enthusiasm, "you shall yet receive the honour that is due to you
"May the Lord be with you also!" answered Messenius, in the same tone, and with curiosity mingled with inquietude
"Go!" said he, short and sharp; "go, you reprobate boy, back to your brother noblemen, and your sisters, the fine ladies
"Be welcome, you who do not disdain to visit the forsaken!" replied Messenius with unusual courtesy
What seek you in the plain peasant's 'stuga,' which you despise?  Go!  I have no longer a son!"  But the youth went not
"Do you recognise me, Johannes Messenius?" said the stranger, as he let the light fall on his pale face
Who sent me out amongst the great and illustrious ones of the earth, to win fame and honour?  Who bade me go to the war to ennoble my peasant name with great deeds?  Who exposed me to the temptation of all the brilliant examples which surrounded the king?  You, and only you, my father; and now you thrust away your son, who for your sake twice refused a patent of nobility
"You renounce a patent of nobility, you, who have blushed for your peasant name and taken another which would look more imposing?  No, on your knees have you begged for a coat of arms
"  "Do you remember a boy in Braunsberg, some years younger than yourself, who was educated with you in the school of the holy fathers, and afterwards in your company visited Rome and Ingolstadt?"  "Yes, I remember
all this have I tried to teach you, and the fruit of my teachings has been that you have smuggled yourself among this nobility, which I hate and despise, that you have coveted its empty titles, paraded with its extravagant display, imbibed its prejudices, and now you stand here, in your father's house, with a lie on your lips, and aristocratic vanity in your heart
I will restore you to freedom and life
"Hullo, boys!" they exclaimed to the hands, "have you seen her?  Here is something that will pay
"  "Why should I not know all this, my honoured friend; have not the great Messenius' work and deeds flown on the wings of fame throughout Germany?  But what you have done, has been done as a blind, so as to work in secret for the highest good of our holy Roman Church
'  The Holy Virgin will give you her absolution as soon as you have worked for her sake
"Wretch, what did you say?" he exclaimed
"Ho, ho, if you please!  Be a little more careful when you speak to the people of the Royal Majesty and the Crown
Yes, esteemed man, even had you seven times abjured your faith, and seven times seventy sinned against all the saints and the dogmas of the Church, it shall all be accounted to you for reward, and not for condemnation, provided you have done it with a mental reservation, and with the design of thereby serving the good cause
I tell you that the German traitress, the papistical sorceress, Lady von Emmeritz, succeeded in escaping last night from Korsholm castle, and that he who does not help to catch her is a traitor and a
Courage, great man, I absolve you in the name of the Church
"Ha, my father, you have wished it!" cried the young man, and in a flash was outside the door and in his sleigh, which at the next moment was heard driving off through the raging tempest
"  "Listen attentively to what I have to say!  Do you think, old man, that I, without important reasons, have ventured up here in the wilderness, daily exposed to hunger, cold, wild beasts, and the still wilder people in this country, who would burn me alive if they knew who I was, and what I was about?  Do you think I would have left the wide field in my native land, had I not hoped to accomplish more here?  Well, then, I will briefly explain to you my point
"  "What do you dare to say?" burst out Messenius, with undisguised surprise
"Wherever you like," answered his master just as testily
"Ass!" he cried, "have I not ordered you to drive north?"  "North!" repeated Pekka mechanically, and with a heavy sigh turned his horses towards Ny-Karleby, to which town it was quite forty miles
All know that you are Sweden's most learned man and greatest historian
They know that you possess and hold in your care more historical documents and secrets than anyone else in the whole kingdom
"  "Do you not see something resembling a light, far away there in the woods?"  "Yes, yes, it looks like it
"  "Nonsense!  I tell you that we will ride there
"  "What do you dare to say?" exclaimed Messenius with burning cheeks
to me that you make this proposal?"  "Yes," added the monk, in the same tone
"  "You fool, it is only the pure snow!--and then you say people could not stand it any longer?"  "They all moved away, so that there was not even a cat left, except an old cottager, but I suppose he died long ago
"I realise that Gustaf Adolf will cause you the most trouble, and therefore I will be responsible for him
Did not I tell you that it would be so?  We shall never get out of this alive
Do you not see the old fire-place sticking out through the snow?  Not a step farther, master!"  "I am not mistaken
"You arch-villain! you liar! you infamous traitor, to lay your hand on the holiest; do you think that I, Johannes Messenius, have worked for long years to become Sweden's greatest historian, to all of a sudden, in such an infamous way, violate the historical truth which I have re-established with such long and continuous efforts?  Be off this moment, quick
"Have you forgotten, old man," he said, in a measured and commanding tone, whilst every word was followed by a pause to increase its effect, "the penalty which the Church and the laws of our holy order inflict for sins like yours?  For apostasy: death
"I have told you that nobody but the devil himself lives in these woods
and you have seven times apostatized!
"  "Yes, you are right," said Bertel, now smiling at his own fears, and what he considered to be the offspring of his heated fancy
and you have seven times blasphemed!
And yet you have just had a large fire kindled in the fire-place
"Will you now confess, old wretch?" burst out the excited young man
and you have seven times disobeyed!
"Well, then," added the Jesuit in a haughty tone or superiority, "I have given you the choice between glory and perdition; I will once more place it before you, although you are undeserving
"Wretch," he exclaimed, "are you tired of life, or do you not know what you are doing, dotard?  What hinders me from crushing your miserable carcase against the walls of your own hut?"  The old man looked at him with an unchanging countenance
"Do so, Bertila's son," he replied; "kill your mother's old faithful servant if you wish; why should he live any longer?"  "My mother's old servant, do you say?"  "I am the last survivor of all those who formerly inhabited this fertile region, which is now a wilderness
Do you imagine, miserable apostate, that I, the head of the German and Northern Jesuits, who do not acknowledge any superior except the Holy Father at Rome--do you believe that I, who have braved myriads of dangers to seek you here in your miserable corner, will allow you to stop me, the invisible ruler of the whole North, with your disobedience and irresolution?  I ask you once more, in the name of our holy order, if you, Johannes Messenius, will be faithful to the oath you swore in your youth, and implicitly obey the behests and commands which I, your superior and judge, enjoin upon you?"  "Yes, holy father," answered the trembling captive; "yes, I will
You say that for your whole life you have striven for a single aim; that of gaining the name of the greatest historian in the North, and you think that you have at last attained your desire?"  "Yes, holy father, that has been my object, and I have obtained it
"  "But are you mad, old man?  If you are, as you say, my mother's old servant, why did you shut me up in that damned hole?  You must admit that your friendship is of a strange kind
Kill me, I am a Catholic!"  "You!  Well, by my sword now I begin to understand you
"  "Your aim is evil!" exclaimed the Jesuit in stern tones, "and it is that of the devil, for you have worked for your own glory, and not for that of the holy Church, as you have sworn
Therefore, I command you to destroy, with your own hands, the idol of your life--your great fame with posterity--by perverting history and writing it, not as it is, but as it ought to be
"  "And on my arrival you concealed them
"  "Then you decoyed me into that miserable rat-hole, while you allowed the women and the monk to escape
I order you to cast away fame, to serve the cause of the Roman Church in the North
And I will that you base this new history on such reliable documents, that in the eyes of the people they will be above suspicion
"  "And what do you think that your reward will be?"  "Anything--death, perhaps
"  "I will spare your life on one condition: you shall show me the way the fugitives have taken
documents which do not exist, but which you shall manufacture
"  "My life; I told you that I was ninety years old
God's kingdom on earth, as wise as it is almighty, as good as it is holy and wise?"  "But is it then we who dictate to God what is good and right?  Has He not Himself told us that truth, _such as it is_?"  "Ha! vacillating apostate, you still dare to argue with your superior about right and wrong
"  "And you do not fear the torture?"  "The saints be praised, if I was worthy of so great an honour
Will you obey my commands?"  "Yes, I will obey," answered the crushed and terrified prisoner
"  "But if I burn you alive in your own hut?"  "The holy martyrs have been burnt at the stake
She saw the ruinous inward strife which raged in Messenius; a struggle for life and death between fanaticism on the one hand, which bade him sacrifice fame and posterity for the victory of the Church, and ambition on the other, which continually pleaded to him not to sacrifice with his own hand his whole life's work?  "Will you," it said, "blindly desecrate the sanctuary of history?  Will you expose to contempt the brilliant name, which in the night of captivity still constitutes your wealth and pride?"  Lucia saw all this with the discernment of love; she saw that the man for whom she lived an entire life of self-denial and restraint, would sink under this terrible internal battle, and she resolved to save him with a bold and decisive stroke
"But I will tell you one thing," he continued, "you think that I have come to take the fugitives back to their prison
"Do I not give you a name," he said, "far greater and more abiding than the one you lose--a name in the chronicles of our holy order; a name among the martyrs and benefactors of the Church; a name which may one day be counted amongst the saints?"  "But, in spite of all this, a name without honour, a liar's, a forger's name!" burst out Messenius, with the despair of a condemned man, who is shown the glory of Heaven obscured by the scaffold
"Weak, vain man, you do not know that great aims are never won by the fear or praise of humanity!" said the Jesuit in a contemptuous tone
I give you my word of honour, that I will defend Lady Regina's freedom with my life's blood, and do all in my power to favour her flight
Will you now tell me which way she has gone?"  "No, your grace," said the calm old man; "the young lady is under the protection of the saints, and a wise man's guidance
"Well," she said in a mocking tone, "three paces from death, sir; what do you wish?"  "Mad woman!" screamed the Jesuit, foaming with rage, "you do not know what you have done!  Miserable thief, you have stolen a kingdom from your Church, and Paradise from your husband
Turn back, you will not find any trace of the fugitives
"  "And from you I have stolen your booty; his secure prey from the wolf; is it not so?" replied Lucia, whose voice began to glow with the fire of her hasty temper
You fear lest I conceal a man's arm under my grey frock, which could hurl you into the cataract's abyss
To-night you are at liberty to walk, if you choose, six miles through the high snow-drifts, to the nearest farm
To-morrow you can ride comfortably
I do not throw you out of the window
"  "Wretch! you have sent my horses away?"  "Yes, your grace
Tremble, monk, I know you!  Lucia Grothusen has followed your steps; you are betrayed, and she has done this
"  "Lucia Grothusen," said the Jesuit with much suavity, "when you were a child, and followed your father, Arnold Grothusen, who was expelled with King Sigismund, you came one day as an exile in need, and surrounded by enemies, to a peasant's hut
you must be hungry
Old man, where do you keep your snow-shoes?"  "My snow-shoes?" replied the old man, confused
They refused you a refuge, and threatened to deliver you up
"Well, old friend," exclaimed the young cavalier, "what do you think of my horses?
You took the image and kissed it; you held it up before the harsh inmates of the hut, and said to them, 'See, the Virgin Mary is here, she will succour us!'"  "Well, what then?" said Lucia reluctantly in a softer voice
I call them mine, for I will bet anything that you will sell them to me for three hard silver thalers: swifter steeds have seldom hurried over high snow-drifts
no, what do I say?  The Holy Virgin moved the stern peasants, they gave you shelter, and placed you all in security
Still more, they gave you the image, which you have carefully preserved as your guardian angel, and there it hangs on your wall
If you have any greeting for the monk or Lady Regina, I will take it with pleasure
What you formerly said, you still say: 'The Virgin Mary is here, she will protect me!'"  Lucia tried in vain to struggle against her emotions
It will be certain death to you
My life is in your hands; denounce me; I flee not; I die for my faith, and I forgive you my death
But I forgive you for the sake of your excellent snow-shoes
"  "Fly from here," said Lucia, half vanquished; "I give you till to-morrow, but only on condition that you do not see my husband again
"Scoundrel!" cried Bertel, with glad surprise, "who sent you here?"  "Who?" repeated Pekka, equally delighted and astonished
"Well, I shall tell you that the devil did it
If you are convinced that I ask only the truth itself from your husband, will you assist instead of trying to destroy your Church?"  "Yes, I will!" answered Lucia warmly and earnestly
But do you know one thing, Pekka: there are moments when hunger and want of sleep are even stronger than love itself
"_Abi, Abi!_ you are not a human being, you are the prince of lies himself, you are the tempter in Paradise!  Get ye gone, ye foul spirit, to the eternal fire, your abiding place, to the kingdom of lies, your realm!" he said in Latin
"I have looked for you everywhere, and you have abandoned me!"  "Hush!" said the Jesuit whispering
This wood is good, and I take it, as you see, Excellency, right before the face of these vagabonds, who deserve to all hang upon the highest pine in the Paldamo forest
Pack yourselves off, you lazy, good-for-nothing rascals, and look out how you act before me and the Governor
"  "Not before you have made Dorthe well again
I beseech you, my father; you are wise, you know all the remedies; give her an immediate restorative, and we will follow you wherever you choose
And you, Lucia, I warn you to hold your wicked tongue, which has already done so much mischief; otherwise it may happen that I shall again put you and your husband in that basement you know of, where Erik Hare kept you, and where the stream rolls right under the floor
Is this the thanks I get for the mild treatment I have bestowed upon you, that you are eternally exciting quarrels in the castle?  The day before yesterday you gave rein to your tongue, because you did not receive enough soap for your washing; yesterday you took a leg of mutton by force from my kitchen, and to-day you make a noise about the wood
Then she drank the beverage of strengthening herbs which you have prepared for her every evening
"How long do you think that mine will last
"  "My child, my daughter, what are you saying?  Grief has clouded your reason; come, I forgive you
"  "She was a burden to you
Mark what I say: Sweden's greatest man; for the day will arrive when you, and I, and all these souls of lard, all these wandering ale-jugs, will be food for worms, and no more thought of than the hogs you killed to-day; but the glorious name of Johannes Messenius will shine for all time
Your patience!  Have I, then, had none--I who in these long weary years have been fighting with you for a bit of bread, for firewood, for a pillow for this great man, whom you abuse?  I, the only one who has kept his frail body alive, and strengthened his soul for the great work which he has now accomplished?  Do you realise what it means to suffer as I have; to be snatched away from one's children, to go about with despair in the heart, and a smile on the lips, so as to seem to have a hope when none remains?
And now you wish me to place myself in your power without protection
Remember _where_ you are, unfortunate, and _who_ you are
Do you know, your Excellency, what all this means?  And you stand there and talk about your patience!"  The soldiers' loud laughter all at once interrupted the voluble old woman
A moment's delay, and I leave you here a prey to want, captivity, and death; a target for the heretic's scorn, a lost sheep abandoned by the Holy Virgin
"Swear," she said, "that you are innocent of Dorthe's death!"  "I swear it!" exclaimed the Jesuit, "by the cross and by the holy Loyola's bones
A little noise, however, was unavoidable; the old man at the table, startled from his thoughts, began to upbraid the intruder:  "Woman!" he said, "how dare you disturb me!  Have I not told you _iterum iterumque_, that you shall take away your _penates procul a parnasso_?  Do you understand it
_lupa_?"  "Dear Messenius, I am only bringing you a little wood
"  "What did you say?" cried the driver of the sleigh in alarm
"My lady," he said in a slightly tremulous voice, "since my hope of finding you at Korsholm failed, I have pursued you through forest and wilderness, as one pursues a criminal
I will not do it again; next time I will lay a mat under the wood, so that it will not disturb you
Perhaps you divine the cause that prompted me to do so
Now I will cook you a splendid leg of mutton for supper
"  "What, woman! have you dared to beg _beneficia_ from tyrants?  By Jupiter, do you think me a dog, that I should eat the crumbs from their tables?  And then you limp
You cannot have meant to take an unhappy young maiden back to prison; you have only wished to snatch her from a man whom the poor deceived one has ever since childhood regarded as a holy and pious person, and whose deeply concealed wickedness she has now, for the first time, learned to know and abhor
"It is true I shuddered when I found that you were under the escort of this villain, whose real character I knew before you, and I then redoubled my efforts to deliver you from his hands
Why do you do that?  Answer me; why do you limp?  I suppose you have been running around like a gossiping old woman, and tripped on the stairs
But before I imagined any danger from that quarter, I flew to find you with the glad tidings of a justice
Let me see the epitaph of the great Johannes Messenius!"  "Certainly," said the old man, consoled by her sincere flattery, "you are decidedly the true _persona executrix_ who ought to read my _epitaphium_, as you are also the one who will have to engrave it on my tombstone
Look, my dear; what do you think of this?  "Here lie the bones of Doctoris Johannes Messenii
"  "A justice, you say?" repeated Regina, with an emotion which sent the blood to her cheeks
Do you know I have a feeling that its glory will in a short time prepare freedom for you
You are free! you can now return to your Fatherland under the protection of the Swedish arms, and here"--with these words Bertel bent one knee and handed Regina a paper with the regency's seal attached--"is the document which ensures your freedom
"Herr chevalier," she said in short measured tones, "I know that you do not desire my thanks for having acted like a man of honour before any of your compatriots
"Yes, you are right; the freedom of the grave to decay wherever one chooses
Each and all of my countrymen would have done the same as I, had not the exigencies of war made them forget the reparation you had a right to demand
"  "No," replied Lucia with eagerness and enthusiasm, "you shall yet receive the honour that is due to you
"May the Lord be with you also!" answered Messenius, in the same tone, and with curiosity mingled with inquietude
and as if he himself had said to her in the well-remembered tones: "Regina, you hate me!"  This impression came so swiftly, so strongly, and with such a surprising power, that Regina suddenly grew pale, staggered, and was compelled to lean on Bertel's outstretched arm
"Holy Virgin!" she whispered, bewildered, and not knowing what she uttered, "should I hate you
"Be welcome, you who do not disdain to visit the forsaken!" replied Messenius with unusual courtesy
"Do you recognise me, Johannes Messenius?" said the stranger, as he let the light fall on his pale face
and with you the certainty of this terrible man's death
"  "Do you remember a boy in Braunsberg, some years younger than yourself, who was educated with you in the school of the holy fathers, and afterwards in your company visited Rome and Ingolstadt?"  "Yes, I remember
I will restore you to freedom and life
Bertel now, as before, bends a knee, and says in a voice at once humble and confident:  "My father!"  "Who are you?  I know you not; I have no son!" said the old man in chilling tones
"  "Why should I not know all this, my honoured friend; have not the great Messenius' work and deeds flown on the wings of fame throughout Germany?  But what you have done, has been done as a blind, so as to work in secret for the highest good of our holy Roman Church
It depends upon you whether I ever return
'  The Holy Virgin will give you her absolution as soon as you have worked for her sake
Remember, my father, that your blessing gives you back a son; that your curse drives him into exile for ever
Yes, esteemed man, even had you seven times abjured your faith, and seven times seventy sinned against all the saints and the dogmas of the Church, it shall all be accounted to you for reward, and not for condemnation, provided you have done it with a mental reservation, and with the design of thereby serving the good cause
Give it to the one you consider more worthy than I
"  All around the old man, except Regina, fell on their knees and exclaimed:  "Grace for Bertel!  Grace for your son!"  "And if I had a son, do you believe he would for my sake give up his desire for the false distinctions of nobility?  Do you think he would become a peasant like me, a man of the people, ready to live and die for their cause?  Do you fancy that he would plough the earth with his fine-gloved hands and choose a wife from my station, a simple plain woman, befitting the spouse of a husbandman?"  "My father," replied Bertel, in a voice more tremulous than before, "what you ask is impossible on account of the education you have yourself bestowed on me
Courage, great man, I absolve you in the name of the Church
Here is my wife; she is a prince's daughter, but she has chosen a peasant's son for her husband; this is a proof that she will not blush to call you father
"  "Listen attentively to what I have to say!  Do you think, old man, that I, without important reasons, have ventured up here in the wilderness, daily exposed to hunger, cold, wild beasts, and the still wilder people in this country, who would burn me alive if they knew who I was, and what I was about?  Do you think I would have left the wide field in my native land, had I not hoped to accomplish more here?  Well, then, I will briefly explain to you my point
"Old man," he said in a voice full of anger, "thank your name of father and your grey head that you have been allowed to utter what no one else should have uttered and live an hour afterwards
"  "What do you dare to say?" burst out Messenius, with undisguised surprise
you are innocent of his death; he gave you away, and then came the bullets and death
All know that you are Sweden's most learned man and greatest historian
They know that you possess and hold in your care more historical documents and secrets than anyone else in the whole kingdom
Do you know, Gustaf Bertel, and you, his wife, the power of this ring?  In my youth I one day went into the wilderness, and there found a dying man, who was languishing from thirst
He thanked me and said: 'My friend, I die, and have no other recompense to give you than this ring
"  "What do you dare to say?" exclaimed Messenius with burning cheeks
to me that you make this proposal?"  "Yes," added the monk, in the same tone
Come, Larsson the younger, you, who are also of peasant origin, and who wish to return to your station, although you too have been a soldier
"I realise that Gustaf Adolf will cause you the most trouble, and therefore I will be responsible for him
I will give you something which is neither gold or a useless ornament, but which will bring you more blessings than all the kings' rings in the world
May it pass in inheritance within your family, and I promise you that he who possesses my axe shall be blessed with happiness and contentment of mind in his honest labour
"You arch-villain! you liar! you infamous traitor, to lay your hand on the holiest; do you think that I, Johannes Messenius, have worked for long years to become Sweden's greatest historian, to all of a sudden, in such an infamous way, violate the historical truth which I have re-established with such long and continuous efforts?  Be off this moment, quick
Do you not see, Bertila, that our Lord has intended the boys for friends?
"Have you forgotten, old man," he said, in a measured and commanding tone, whilst every word was followed by a pause to increase its effect, "the penalty which the Church and the laws of our holy order inflict for sins like yours?  For apostasy: death
and you have seven times apostatized!
and you would make them enemies by taking from one and giving to the other
Can you believe that he, the fresh-baked nobleman, whom you compare with the fire, could be induced to give away the ring and take the axe in its place?"  "Never!" excitedly exclaimed Bertel
and you have seven times blasphemed!
A peaceful death or a peaceful life is an abomination to him; but you, Larsson, tell me: have you a desire to give away the axe and take the ring?"  "H'm!" thoughtfully replied the captain; "if the ring were of gold, I might sell it in town and get a good cask of ale for the money
and you have seven times disobeyed!
My blessing on you and your descendants
"Well, then," added the Jesuit in a haughty tone or superiority, "I have given you the choice between glory and perdition; I will once more place it before you, although you are undeserving
Do you imagine, miserable apostate, that I, the head of the German and Northern Jesuits, who do not acknowledge any superior except the Holy Father at Rome--do you believe that I, who have braved myriads of dangers to seek you here in your miserable corner, will allow you to stop me, the invisible ruler of the whole North, with your disobedience and irresolution?  I ask you once more, in the name of our holy order, if you, Johannes Messenius, will be faithful to the oath you swore in your youth, and implicitly obey the behests and commands which I, your superior and judge, enjoin upon you?"  "Yes, holy father," answered the trembling captive; "yes, I will
May there be war and not peace between them and you until the useless glitter disappears from humanity
You say that for your whole life you have striven for a single aim; that of gaining the name of the greatest historian in the North, and you think that you have at last attained your desire?"  "Yes, holy father, that has been my object, and I have obtained it
"  "But, my father," exclaimed Bertel in an entreating voice, "have you then no blessing to give me, and my posterity, at the moment when we separate for ever?"  "You!" repeated the old man, in still angry tones
"Go, you lost, vain, worm-eaten branch of the people's great trunk; go in your pitiful parade to certain ruin
"  "Your aim is evil!" exclaimed the Jesuit in stern tones, "and it is that of the devil, for you have worked for your own glory, and not for that of the holy Church, as you have sworn
until then I give you my curse as an inheritance, even unto the tenth generation, and with it shall follow dissension, hatred, war, and finally a despicable fall
Therefore, I command you to destroy, with your own hands, the idol of your life--your great fame with posterity--by perverting history and writing it, not as it is, but as it ought to be
I order you to cast away fame, to serve the cause of the Roman Church in the North
"Farewell, my former father!  Farewell, my Fatherland!  I go never to see you again!"  "One moment," interrupted Meri, who with a violent effort placed herself in his way
But before you leave me, you shall take with you the secret which has been both my life's highest joy and its greatest agony
And I will that you base this new history on such reliable documents, that in the eyes of the people they will be above suspicion
"Do you not see that he goes
documents which do not exist, but which you shall manufacture
For every curse you throw upon his head, I will give him a hundred blessings, and we shall see which will avail the most before the throne of the Supreme Being--your hatred or my love--the grandfather's curse or the mother's blessing
God's kingdom on earth, as wise as it is almighty, as good as it is holy and wise?"  "But is it then we who dictate to God what is good and right?  Has He not Himself told us that truth, _such as it is_?"  "Ha! vacillating apostate, you still dare to argue with your superior about right and wrong
Ah! it is so new and so sweet to call you so
Will you obey my commands?"  "Yes, I will obey," answered the crushed and terrified prisoner
Now you know my life's secret
She saw the ruinous inward strife which raged in Messenius; a struggle for life and death between fanaticism on the one hand, which bade him sacrifice fame and posterity for the victory of the Church, and ambition on the other, which continually pleaded to him not to sacrifice with his own hand his whole life's work?  "Will you," it said, "blindly desecrate the sanctuary of history?  Will you expose to contempt the brilliant name, which in the night of captivity still constitutes your wealth and pride?"  Lucia saw all this with the discernment of love; she saw that the man for whom she lived an entire life of self-denial and restraint, would sink under this terrible internal battle, and she resolved to save him with a bold and decisive stroke
Do you love me?
"Do I not give you a name," he said, "far greater and more abiding than the one you lose--a name in the chronicles of our holy order; a name among the martyrs and benefactors of the Church; a name which may one day be counted amongst the saints?"  "But, in spite of all this, a name without honour, a liar's, a forger's name!" burst out Messenius, with the despair of a condemned man, who is shown the glory of Heaven obscured by the scaffold
"Weak, vain man, you do not know that great aims are never won by the fear or praise of humanity!" said the Jesuit in a contemptuous tone
I forgive you
that you have hated and cursed your daughter's son
"Well," she said in a mocking tone, "three paces from death, sir; what do you wish?"  "Mad woman!" screamed the Jesuit, foaming with rage, "you do not know what you have done!  Miserable thief, you have stolen a kingdom from your Church, and Paradise from your husband
"  "And from you I have stolen your booty; his secure prey from the wolf; is it not so?" replied Lucia, whose voice began to glow with the fire of her hasty temper
"  "My mother!" exclaimed Bertel, "hear me, my mother!  I thank you
You shall go with me, and I will never desert you
You fear lest I conceal a man's arm under my grey frock, which could hurl you into the cataract's abyss
But you do not hear me
I do not throw you out of the window
Tremble, monk, I know you!  Lucia Grothusen has followed your steps; you are betrayed, and she has done this
"  "Lucia Grothusen," said the Jesuit with much suavity, "when you were a child, and followed your father, Arnold Grothusen, who was expelled with King Sigismund, you came one day as an exile in need, and surrounded by enemies, to a peasant's hut
